Most size charts that give more than one number size for the letter size will fit that range. Not these. XL on all the tags but the sewn in tab states it is a size 16 whereas the size chart states an XL is 16 and 18. I prefer my bottoms to have some room. These shorts are fitted so every curve shows. At a 16, these fit but have no room. Anything added to the pockets would make an undesirable bulge. I will be taking them on vacation but do not have confidence that I will experience much comfort trying to put them on if I am wet. Even with 7% Spandex, there is not much give. It really is a shame that the fit is so off as these are super cute and well made.",

          "title": "The Paint Never Cured!",
          "review_text": "I bought the Glidden Spred Grab-N-Go interior latex paint, semi-gloss finish in the color Farm from Walmart on April 21, 2025. We painted our bathroom with it a few days later. The walls were originally painted with flat white paint as a primer, and my husband made a few repairs to the sheet rock with drywall joint compound in a few places before we painted, so some surfaces were bare finished sheet rock and some were previously painted. I've been painting walls in houses for the past 40 years, and I've never had a paint do this. After the paint had dried to the touch, we removed the painter's masking tape. On one wall near the shower, the paint peeled off with the tape as if it were a stretchy sheet of latex. I thought maybe the wall there didn't get prepped as well as it should, so I removed the paint, sanded the wall, wiped the dust off, and painted it again. There were a few other places where the paint still felt gummy, so we put fans in the room and waited a few more days before attempting to remove the rest of the masking tape. After that, the tape mostly came off without damaging the paint, and I touched up the few places that peeled. The paint still felt kind of soft, so we decided to wait a few days more before we started to put trim and the mirror back up. After almost 2 weeks, the paint still felt soft, so I contacted Walmart to request a refund. I also called Glidden to report my issue and ask for advice as to how to get the paint to cure. The representative suggested that we get plenty of air flow into the room, which we had already done. My husband had the idea to put a space heater in there and close the door, and the representative agreed that was worth a try. He had no other suggestions except that if it didn't cure, I would most likely have to remove the paint and start over. 😕 Our best guess is that the paint was frozen in shipping somewhere before it got to the store since the manufacture date on the can is February. It's now been almost a month, and the paint has stayed soft. Any little bump against the wall makes a nick in the paint, including just brushing against it lightly with a fingernail. Today, I decided to remove some of the paint at those nicked places, and the paint just peels away like dead skin. It's going to take hours to remove all the paint from the walls. I'm not sure I trust this product enough to buy another one and repaint or if I'm just going to wallpaper the whole room. This is very frustrating. I would like to add that the color and coverage of this paint were great. Applying the paint was easy. But none of that matters if the paint never dries. Another note. We did purchase a second gallon of this exact paint except in the color white. We painted our doors and trim with it, and it cured just fine. https://youtube.com/shorts/TjJZBwVIgo4?si=AEUGKTJa_irRHDvP",

Well, I received them and put them on and they are cut really small! I ordered size 9/10 (the biggest size) I usually take a 9 or 9 1/2 in shoes. These were not very cushiony, but since they were relatively cheap that would have been okay and I would have lived with it if they weren't so small. It says they are washable, but if they shrank, I cannot imagine being able to get my feet in them. They are the biggest size and I should have had an extra half size leeway, but these feel very tight. I came on here to check to make sure the size was right, but i don't know because there is no size on the actual slipper, and there was no paperwork inside the package. So either they are not a 9/10, or they are cut extremely small. I may have to return these if I wash them and they no longer fit.",

Either way, they're otherwise what I was looking for. Durable soft socks with \"padded\" soles that, to a point, actually \"massage\" your feet. Very comfortable. So, unless I find some other ones, still Hanes of course, I will likely buy more of these in the future. However, I WILL NEVER order directly from Hanes.com again. It seems their left hand doesn't know what the right one is doing. First, my package ships and I get an email about it, but NO tracking info. So, I have to contact them about it and, lo and behold, not 2 days later my package arrives. Finally, A MONTH later, they send me tracking info that leads to UPS where it tells me my package has been delivered. And, here's the kicker, after that same months time, they finally took their payment from my checking account. If not for that, I probably would have given 5 stars. As it is, the product is carrying 3 stars now and the service 1.",

According to WikiPedia, it started at JC Penney. My interest was the sweatshirt and how it fits and feels. I think I covered fit in the first paragraph. The shirt itself is really nothing special. It is a blended fabric like so many others sold in Walmart, Target, Dollar General, etc.... That means that this shirt is one you buy because you like the Airwalk brand or you think the print is cool. I think the print is cool. So I like it. Typical sweatshirt, aka: Hoodie. Cool print. Buy it because of the design. Do not think that it is a special sweatshirt or Hoodie variant. This sweatshirt has caused me to think about other Airwalk branded products. I will look into those and see if I can match them with my new hoodie. It is fashionable and drives my child crazy that I know the brand and am wearing this hoodie. She does not think it is cool on me! Look at the photos and decide for yourself.",

Aside from being too small for me, I liked the design features with a small logo in pink on the front, pink “walking people” on both sleeves, a large 9.5x9 inch (predominately pink and black) walking person on the back, and even a pink logo on the top of the hood. I liked the oversized front pocket (14x9 inches) which is large enough to hold gloves, keys, phone, wallet or to keep your hands warm in cold weather. I like how the wrist cuffs and waistband has a nice stretch to them. The fleece lining will definitely keep you warm in cold weather. The half-inch wide drawstring for the hoodie was nice and strong. The workmanship appears to be superb. I liked everything about this hoodie. I just need a size (or two) larger.",

The material is thin enough to move with you, but thick enough to keep you warm when there's a chill in the air. The drawstrings have heat shrink on the ends of them which are softer and much better than the hard plastic most others use. The tag is a little itchy, but that is easily solved by cutting it out. The hood isn't too heavy feeling which I like because it doesn't feel like it's in the way.",

Anyway, that 159$ one crapped the bed after like a week of having it. I noticed it when I was food shopping after work and I looked at it and it said I only did 1,000 steps while my phone tracked 16,000 steps. So I was on the hunt for another smartwatch and I came across this one and I figured why not try this next. I love it! I kinda wish it had more options when using your own photo for the background but whatever it's no biggie in that aspect. Charges fast, counts my steps accurately, love the watch band love all the features on it altogether! I recommend this watch!",

I wore the item for 2 days, it stopped syncing to the app. I thought maybe if I turned the watch off and then back on, it would start syncing. Instead, I could never get it to turn back on again - Even after sitting on the charger over night. It also only has selected apps for which notifications will work so if you have something like the Ring or Teams or something not included, there is no way to get notifications on the watch",

The tips are nice to change the placement or pinpoint an area. It has 2 speeds which the higher speed seems to do more to relieve discomfort. The only other con would be that it didn't come with a small travel bag to put it and all the other tips in. Since it's supposed to be portable, a carry bag or strage bag of some kind would have been nice.",

For reference I had just had nutty %26 fruity brand Dubai Chocolate bars which had almost 3 times the filling. Chocolate itself was good but could barely make out the pistachio and kadayif which was the whole point of getting this bar vs a milk chocolate bar for 1/3rd of the price.",

But i cannot recomend these shoes to my fellow chefs and cooks out there.",

The included weights are 2.5 lbs and 7.5 lbs. The step up from a 5 lb dumbbell to a 15 lb. dumbbell is too extreme, at least to this old fud. In my opinion either a 5 lb weight should be the highest weight, or a 5 lb weight should be included, for which I would have paid more. If Walmart carries the 5 lb weights I will order them. I did find the weight set to be well-made and the clamps easy to use. I also found that the bars are slightly too short for my hands, so the weights rub on the outside of my knuckles when I am working out.",

Looks like a big hollow tube is welded on a little hollow tube. Not sure how this will affect durability, though mine haven't broken so far. 1a. The welds are not clean; because of the welds, the plates won't sit flat against the inside collars. 2. The spring clips are junk. If you're using heavy weights, you'll need a screw on or other type of heavy-duty collar. Overall, these will probably work for most aplpications. If you're using heavy weights (which is why i opted for olympic bars), especially with the dumbbells, which tend to take more abuse than the curl bar, you're probably better off getting a higher quality solid set.",

I felt like it was somewhat thick and crunchy than I really wanted it to be.I didn't care for the flavor to much. The Pizza sauce was mild and the only thing on the pizza that had flavor was the pepperoni. The cheese was on their with it being the correct amount.
