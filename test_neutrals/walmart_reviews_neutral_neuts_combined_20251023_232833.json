While on the drive, I noticed the smell of propane in my car. This heater was leaking propane. I immediately disassembled it and continued on. At the campsite, I attached two different bottles of new propane bottles, and you could hear the hiss of a leak. No matter how I careful to make sure it was screwed on and tightened.

However, the burn is clean and great for the first hour and a half, then the flames start going smaller and smaller. They have cut the quality or made a negative change because they use to do the three hours as advertised and as they use to. I am pretty much forced to use these as I have not found any other that I like better. We use these in a fireplace. I'm sitting here looking at one barely burning that I put in one hour and fifty five minutes ago and the flame is barely coming out. Now, if I poke it and break it up into small pieces, it will burn big for a few minutes and then dwindle down to nothing rather quickly. They are great to start a new wood fire quickly, like the one person said, \"put the log under the wood and then light it\". To me they are better than the fire starters to get a fire started quickly. - burn good - no odors - great for starting the wood fire Do not last three hours",

It's ability to heat a room is greatly diminished on the low setting.",

Even though I left my faucet dripping my water still froze. I know nothing about fireplaces. I live in an apt with a fire place and I've never used it, but I thought I would give it a go in these artic temps. I bought 2 2-hour Duraflame logs from Freds. They lasted even more than 2 hours and I enjoyed the experience. I went to Walmart to check out the selection and bought a 6-pk box of 3-hour Pine Mountain logs. The first log burned big and fast. I thought maybe it did that because I lit it in 4 different places, so I burned another exactly following the lighting directions. The log still burned big and in and 1 hour not 3. Also the air filter on my central heater was black. Hmm, don't know if I'll give Druaflame another try, but definitely will not buy any more Pine Mountain. In fact, I'm going to return the remaining logs. I don't want to use any kind log if my air filter is going turn black. I didn't notice the filter after I burned the Dualame, but it was very noticeable after the pine mountain.",

I believe this is just an error in the instructions because I do have other screws that I can use, but it's a bit sketchy to assume they are the correct screws. I would also add that you should read the instructions carefully and not rush. It helps a lot to read two steps at a time. For example, if you're on step 2, read step 3 so you know what to do. I have noticed a few times that what one step says to do makes the following steps more difficult. So knowing what I was going to do next helped me avoid those mistakes. Overall, I am happy with this product, but I do think the price could have been a little lower because this product is not made up of tiny pieces of wood.",

However, once assembled, the final product is sturdy, beautiful, and the fireplace works great. A heads-up: if you only have one electrical outlet for both the fireplace and TV, this setup won't work. The fireplace requires its own dedicated outlet, so you'll need to find another outlet for the TV or other devices.",

However, that being said, in the end the cabinet stands (it's fairly sturdy, considering the thin metal), shelves hold, doors work and handle mechanism works and locks (just don't plan on securing your life savings in this cabinet).

The shelves look nice and were easy to assemble. While the framing in steel, it is thin steel. It would not be difficult to bend the frame. I didn't expect steel shelving to come in a box labelled \"fragile\". For the under $30 price I paid, the shelves are okay and will server the desired purpose. If you want sturdy, this is not the item to buy. One minor complaint about the fully assemble unit is that the upper half is not actually attached to the lower half. Eventually, I will use eight half inch bolts to secure the upper and lower halves together. I may return the two unopened boxes.",

I couldn't assembe the upper shelves because connections for metal slots became slightly off from corner dents. I returned it to the store. Examine all parts before you build, if NO DENTS, you could build all five levels. 2 people to assemble. Wood shelves are very thin, so is for very light stuff on each shelf. This is not good for medium or heavy containers. I would say each shelf could hold no more than 10 pounds, like towels, blankets and super light hardware, like light weight Christmas decorations.",

The entire unit offers multiple storage sections of varying sizes to accommodate both smaller items as well as some larger ones. Having the base section...which is sizeable...offers mobile use when different areas of work are needed. The adjustable handle is also a very handy feature whether one is transporting one storage section, two sections, or all three. Each removeable section is fastened with sturdy clips that are easy to open as well as back clips to be used when one wishes to remove a section to use separately(see bottom pic). Although this item may be viewed more as something the fellows would use, I believe the ladies will also benefit from possessing one of these units for their gardening needs outside or even for crafts designs as sometimes many small decorative pieces are needed; the top section has multiple small compartments for such items to prevent spillage. I believe most anyone could find a handy use for this particular product that would offer many years of service and options. The only drawback to this unit as I see it would be the heavy weight of some larger tools inside along with the other sections filled to capacity; but, having the cart on wheels makes it mobile so it may not be a problem for the guys. Nice product...thank you.",

          "title": "A flexible storage system for all your needs",
          "review_text": "The HART Mobile Tool Storage System is do-it-yourselfers' ultimate solution to tool storage and organization challenges. It has three stackable sections. The bottom section is wide enough to hold power tools such as a reciprocating saw, a drill, etc... The middle section is not as big, but would still fit smaller tools such as a jigsaw, a sander, etc… plus has a tray for small tools such as a level, tape measure, square etc. This tray can be used in either one of the bottom two sections. The top section is a tray with ten removable compartments for small items such screws, nails, drill bits, etc. Depending on your job need, you have the option to use all three sections at once, only the base section or the base plus one of the other two. The whole system can be rolled around with the help of two solid 7-inch wheels and an extendable handle, a great feature that makes reaching your job site a lot easier especially if you have to go up or down the steps. The top two sections can be released from the storage system and have strong handles so you can carry them away if space is restricted for the whole system. It is worth mentioning that the top tray has a lid that sinks into the ten compartments creating a seal for your items so they don't scatter inside the tray and it is clear so tray contents are visible. Each section interlocks with the section below it for stability while rolling it around and for even more security, the bottom two sections can be locked with padlocks. All three sections come equipped with two strong latches to secure their lids down. If you are a do-it-yourselfer, a craftsman or just need a flexible storage system, The Hart Mobile Tool Storage System is for you. It has a look and feel of high quality construction and presents a variety of storage and organization options depending on your need. Its two wheels and retractable handle allow you to move part or all of the storage system around with ease.",

However, it is plastic and not very sturdy. The shelves can hold only 30 pounds so the items that can be stored in this cabinet are limited. I’m not sure I’d trust a shelf to hold a 6-pack of soda. When you open the box, be surprised to find cracked or broken pieces, missing or duplicate pieces. If you receive all the pieces in good condition, be extremely careful during assembly. This storage cabinet is fairly easy to put together. No tools are required but a rubber mallet may come in handy. Read the assembly instructions, lay out all the parts, take your time and try not to get frustrated. It took me and my daughter longer than it would for most people, even though both of us have years of experience assembling boxed furniture. I cannot, in good faith, recommend this storage cabinet. A metal/steel cabinet, with or without doors, would be a much better investment even though the cost is more.",

Especially because the doors do not close all of the way (including on the sides), water will be able to get in if it is rained on. This is also expensive for what it is. A better price would have been about $80. If you'll have this in the house and don't need the doors to completely close, buy it. If you need it to be outside, buy something else.",

Didn't work, both sides broke off the first time I opened the doors. No matter...doors function fine without them. Big plus, this whole assembly requires NO hardware. On the negative side the instructions leave a lot to be desired especially as far the pictures go. Black on black so doesn't work. It also doesn't work far as the parts being labeled. Took the light hitting just right that I finally even noticed they were labeled. I was about halfway through assembly before I saw them...duh. It did go together well even with the broken middle \"hinges?\" Works well, Shelves are sturdy so all in all I am good with the unit. My biggest bone to pick is Walmart delivery. When I first saw this product in the store there were 3 units sitting on the shelf. I went home and price checked the unit in other places and not only did Walmart have the best price my CC provided a link that allowed me to get 5% cash back.....BONUS. Yeah, so I ordered through the link for pickup the next day. I soon get a noticed telling me not available for pickup and they would ship it to me. Now I'm thinking WOW they sold the 3 units I saw sitting on the shelf that morning. I get the unit a couple days latter via, FEDEX. Assemble it, get it into use...happy camper. UNTIL I am shopping at Walmart a day or so later and low and behold.....all 3 units are still sitting on the shelf. Gotta wonder whether it was a management issue, some weird policy issue or lazy employee issue but someone really needs to address that. 5% cash back to me and God only knows what they paid FedEx to ship it to me. On a $120 purchase the profit margin must be out the roof for them to make any money on that deal. Rant over.",

Assembled it is 18.5 inches long, 25.47 inches wide and 69.38 inches tall. It can be used in bedrooms, bathrooms, patios, garages, and more. It has 4 shelves that are moveable. When I put it together the main part of cupboard was super easy and understandable. Once it came to putt in the shelves it got very confusing. They didn’t fit, took multiple tried to get one shelf to stay in and would require me to push the left “wall” in to get it to snap together. Overall it will work well for holding light simple items but the shelves do collapse sometimes. It is poor quality and flimsy for what it is.",

I also am keeping my car care/washing chemicals, waxs, soaps towels. It took me about an hour to assemble. It would have been nice to have assembly instructions but I managed to figure it out. Nice not to have to use any screws , nuts or bolts, all the pieces just snapped into place. I did have to get out my rubber mallot as some pieces I had ti disassemble as there was an order to put the pieces together. 20 pieces altogether. Which included doors on the front to enclose the shelves. I had a small 1 inch pieces that broke off but you can't see it from tbe front. Overall I am satisfied with my HyperTough storage cabinet.",

We just built it anyway, as the broken parts in the second box were usable even with cracks. Parts of the instructions were unclear, but we got through it. At the end, it feels flimsy, but it does look nice. We were too nervous to put anything heavy in it, since it doesn't seem like it would hold well. Overall, if you need something 'hyper tough', I wouldn't say this is it. It's adequate for lighter items though, and it does look nice.",

This one does serve its purpose in a decent way. You do get what you pay for I guess. The instructions are lacking details in places but you can generally figure it out. There was one step missing, where it showed the picture but didn't say anything about installing the part. I did received mine with a hole in the box and 2 pieces were damaged. They were still usable and it isn't worth the hassle to replace them. The shelves are kind of difficult to \"lock down\" because the plastic is so bendable/warped. There is a QR code that says is a link for video instructions, but it only takes you to the Wal-Mart site for the item. I saw nowhere on that page a link for the instruction video. It is unfortunate you can only upload 2 pictures. I have many to show, good and bad.",

One fits my dryer great my boyfriend did have too bend them down a little the directions tell you that you might have too. The top of my dryer is straight but my washer top is rounded the shelf don't fit it as good we had too fix the washer where the shelf will lean up against the wall so we could use it without falling off but evently that will rub my wall. So they are great if the top of your washer & dryer is straight across at the top if they are rounded you need too find something else.

It won't set level so I have to be extra careful when I take things on and off of it. Also, it wasn't made to hold the larger sizes of product. It moves around as you take things off it. It would probably be OK if my drier didn't have that slight curve to it. The front arms need to be a bit longer. Also, the back arms need to be bent to work for the machine which can cause that to lean back some which is why the front arms need to be longer. I wish there was a better way to secure it to the machine. I'm going to have to figure out a way to make it stay firmly on the machine.
