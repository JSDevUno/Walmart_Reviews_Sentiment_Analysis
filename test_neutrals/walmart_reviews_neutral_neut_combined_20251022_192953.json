What I don't like is how turning it on and off requires the power button to be held down for about two seconds and the button is sunk into the shell rather than being raised to make it easier to find and press. Having the UPS on the floor works better to save desk space, so using my foot to operate the power button saves bending over, but the design makes this less convenient.",

Even more critical is not losing data or days of work due to power outages. I vowed the last time that happened, during an ice storm when the electricity was out for days, that I would invest in a universal power supply. But I could never justify the cost for something that only gets used every now and then. But this battery backup is so affordable, I can't afford not to have it in my home office. My internet modem, computer, and monitor all can be plugged into it so that if, or should I say when the power goes out again -- and it will -- I now have the ability to finish and save my work in progress, upload it safely, and shut everything down properly. Those few extra minutes can potentially save days of work. It's peace of mind at an affordable price. A must-have for anyone who works from home, yet powerful enough for a small office too. Also allows me to charge my phone fully while I still can.",

I also wanted surge protection for a printer, scanner and occasional camera. There are enough receptacles to satisfy those requirements. The only difficulty would be if I increased the devices needing backup because - as always - manufacturers don't even try to follow a standard orientation of power adapters. That means one adapter is taking up one slot and covering up the adjacent one preventing it being used. But that's a potential problem for most backups of this type. It's not a problem yet. I can't comment on the way it works with the PowerPanel management software because I don't want it hooked up and running on my computer. Certainly for an off-the-shelf unit for home use, it's satisfactory. I hope to never find out that it's otherwise.",

          "review_text": "My grandmother is 96 years old and has to breathe concentrated oxygen constantly. The power in her apartment frequently goes out whenever it storms there, so on several occasions over the years she's found herself suddenly suffocating in the dark and forced to try to open a portable oxygen cylinder with arthritic hands. She has never owned a computer and has no need for one, but her oxygen concentrator draws a significant amount of power. The 900 V/A UPS that I use for my computer only lasted 6 minutes under that load, so after some research I settled on this product. This battery backup still only lasts for 15-20 minutes, so it will not provide continuous power through most blackouts, but it gives her enough time for either neighbors, family, or emergency services to check on her and open an oxygen tank or plug the oxygen machine into a generator with an extension cord. The battery alarm will also immediately let her know she needs help if the power goes out in the middle of the night rather than violently coughing herself awake, which is how she used to find out. This device was put to the test less than a month after I put it in her home. She initially panicked when the lights went out, but realized after 30 seconds that she could still breathe. The UPS worked exactly the way I hoped it would. She was able to remain calm and safe until help arrived. I recommend anyone with elderly relatives to consider something like this as an option, but you will need to do some math first and make sure the volts / amps / watts on whatever you're plugging into it will last long enough on battery power to suit your purposes.",

Had to return and buy the only other one walmart had in stock. Second one was actually new and works well. We have 2 gaming computers plugged in both with 750W-800W PSU in them. While gaming, the Battery backup estimates that we would have about 8-10 min of battery life should the power go out, this should give plenty of time to shut our machines down safely. While idle with both pcs on it says about 40 min of time. Only complaint about the product itself is that i wish it had one more spaced out socket on the battery backup side since both my router and modem have bulky plugs.",

Left it off over night and ran it again the next day. It did it again after 12 hours or so. I'm guessing that possibly it is a video problem and is shutting down for some problem.

          "review_text": "Well, I first bought a GMTeck G10 (didnt like it much so returned) and decided to spend a little more and get something better this time and I did (spend quite a lot more but also got more). I don't really need another mini PC having a Mini Mac M4 but happy with this purchase overall. And also the fact this one was discounted when bought it, otherwise I wouldn't have. What you need to know and all those youtube 'experts' reviews dont tell you is this, the cooling is improved over the K6 but still insufficient, I added a SKhynix P41 2TB and it was 'cooking' in the available middle SSD slot. I figured out why SSD comes installed in slot 1 next to wall, it is because next to inlet so better cooling than inside.. You need to move your hotter SSD to this slot 1 for better cooling. Second and more important, early reviews noted it came with BiWin NV 7400 SSD Pcie 4 x 4 and Crucial RAM, so I was happy with that and bought 32GB / 1 TB model but oh surprise, it came with Crucial P3 Plus SSDPcie 3 x 4 and TSWC ram..:(... They went cheap and downgraded on both, Not only P3 Plus speeds is slower but also TBW is a third of NV 7400. And I liked Crucial Rams but gotTSWC instead. If I had known , I would had bought a barebone and installed RAM and SSD myself, but stuck with these now. Finally, intial setup was a breeze ( compared to G10) and pleasently surprised but later it came to bite me, suddenly it crash once for no reason and restarted normal later so thought Ok, but no, when tried migrating my Windows to SK P41, it kept failing many times (wasted more than 5 hours with useless Acronis TrueImage cloner, DONT USE THAT CRAP). Acronis is free if Crucial SSD is installed so it failed (dont know if related to early crash or Acronis is just crap) . Finally went the SK Hynis route and downloaded Macrium cloner (it wont work for you if dont have SK Hynix SSD) and failed twice too but at least was quick, I finally figure it out from logs, I needed to disable Windows Antivirus folder protection , and it cloned successfully in like 20 mins..After that I did a Windows reset by reinstalling a fresh copy of Windows online (solved similarly an issue with G10 and Bluetooth keyboard)So that's my advice , I wish I had known or told before by \"expert\" youtubers but didn't. In insight, I should had bought a K6 or similar BOSGAME M4 etc , much cheaper and very similar overall..But I bought it and not going to return it .. Experience is similar (not same level of course) as mini M4, which crushes in efficiency and performance as user experience but this one is Windows variant so ok.. I think review is like 4 or 4.5 stars overall and I would recommend it to others if on sale and barebone model only..Disappointed with P3 Plus and TSWC current options.",

The attached video was recorded in 4k but it's definitely overexposed with default settings. Given the cost of Onn devices, however, it would likely work just fine for someone who needs a webcam for work, but don't expect amazing quality from it. It also didn't always stay upright and would slump to the side without interference, and I noticed bumping it actually causes distortion instead of just shaking it which makes me question the build quality.",

          "review_text": "I remember when an optical mouse became available. Before then, every few days I'd have to pop the mouse ball out of the mouse, cleaning it and the rollers because it would eventually build up with crap on the rollers making the mouse move erratically. Years later, after my mousepad wore out, I decided I'd try this mouse out since the \"mouse\" itself doesn't move... it's just a matter of rolling around the little mouse ball. What a difference between an optical mouse and a mouse with a ball. I have a 6 year old autistic son, I work out of the house, and I tend to him multiple times a day washing my hands frequently. Even so, after about 2 days, same thing happens with this mouse as did the mouse ball back in the day... the ball builds crud up on it transferring the crud to the internal rollers... having the mouse pointer then move erratically and not smooth. Also, if you need precision with your mouse... easily and quickly clicking somewhere (like in the center of a word), this mouse is no good. After a few weeks of using it, it has cost me time... trying to get the mouse exactly where I'm wanting it. A mouse that moves, if you have your hand/finger on it but not moving the mouse, the mouse pointer won't move. You can't do that with this \"mouse.\" Have your finger on the ball... trying to get it right between 2 letters to click... it's jumpy... part of it is because of the crud the mouse ball picks up. This mouse is okay if you don't use it a lot... but if what you do on the computer involves using the mouse a lot with precision, this isn't the mouse for you. It is very hard to get this mouse/mouse pointer positioned precisely. Something else with this mouse are the buttons, or at least that right mouse button is very soft and I'm continually clicking it (without meaning to). Limited computer use, limited mouse use... this mouse is okay for that. But if you use the mouse a lot and need to precisely place the cursor... this isn't the mouse for you. And having to clean the mouse ball every 2 days or so... just can't do it. With an optical mouse, it's extremely easy to position the mouse pointer between 2 letters then clicking. It is time consuming and difficult to do that with this mouse... and as a programmer who continually needs to place the mouse with precision wherever I'm wanting it... this mouse has been a headache. I'm done cleaning mouse balls... ordered an optical mouse and am back to using it.",

It has great features, like the forward and back buttons on the side, plus, the USB conveniently stores in the battery compartment. However, I only used it for 5 minutes before my laptop crashed. I figured it had to be a fluke, so I tried it on my son's laptop. Shortly after inserting the USB, his screen froze, so I immediately removed it, did a restart and data recovery. Thankfully, his laptop is working fine. Mine won't turn on. I never leave negative reviews, as I like to give products the benefit of the doubt, but I can't in good faith recommend this.

          "review_text": "I have used wireless mice with my laptops for many years now, and always use a laptop computer bag when traveling. Most bags come with at least a side compartment/pocket for accessories such as power supply, cables and mice. I have a fairly expensive full-sized mouse that I use at home, and if I take it with me when I travel, it sticks out like a fist in the side of the bag. This Onn Wireless Travel Mouse solves that issue for me. It is smaller, yet not so small that it is hard for an adult to use. The light grey/black color makes it easy to spot on a dark finish desk or table. At 1600 DPI, it is more sensitive than my full sized mouse (1000 DPI) and has 3 buttons (one is scroll wheel to the right only) in addition to a knurled scroll wheel which I like because my finger doesn't slip on it. It has an on/off switch on the bottom along with a \"connect\" button that I have not had to utilize so far. It comes with 2 AAA Energizer batteries instead of the usual \"off\" brands that other manufacturers provide. The top comes off easily to access the batteries and storage area for the receiver. I have been using this mouse for a week now, and there is nothing I don't like about it. It is well made, feels solid, and is comfortable to use. This not a \"quiet\" mouse, but for the price it is a great deal. It is too early to evaluate the durability of the mouse, or the battery life, but I have other electronics made by Onn, and they are still going strong after a few years, so I expect a long working life for this mouse.",

It does seem to look slightly different (don't have the model numbers to compare) and this one didn't want to connect to the Lenovo laptop (running a Linux environment) that we had purchased it for. Luckily we were able to swap mice and this one worked perfectly fine with the Macbook instead. It's a simple mouse which is what we wanted—wired so no connectivity issues, no extra buttons to accidentally press, small but large enough to be comfortable, etc.",

The buttons are not separate from the body, so the clicking motion can be a little bit on the stiffer side. The shape is okay in that the \"hump\" is on the far end / bottom of the mouse rather than the middle (still comfortable). Very affordable. The weight seems to be good too - not too light nor too heavy. This mouse is practically identical to the one which came with my Lenovo ThinkStation.",

The problem is that once I installed the Windows ISO, all drivers were missing, including the touch pad. I had to use the Tab, Space bar, and Enter keys to navigate through Windows. Windows update did not reinstall the drivers. I had to use a different computer to download a zip file with the Chuwi drivers, and then proceed to use the Tab, Space bar, and Enter keys to reinstall all drivers. I have not had to use this process of installing drivers since Windows XP. Once all drivers were installed, the laptop works great. It is very responsive and a great value for the price paid.
