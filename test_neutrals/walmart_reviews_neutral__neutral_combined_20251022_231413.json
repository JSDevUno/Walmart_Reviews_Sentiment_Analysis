          "review_text": "I initially bought this in blue because it looked like it could be a “safe” color. For the $3 price, I was concerned the colors may be neon, even though not described that way. The blue is a bit neon for public wear, the collar is big and it looked frumpy on me, so I didn't like it, but my mom liked it as a PJ top, so we ordered other colors at the price. We've been pleasantly surprised by the green, purple and especially the WHITE!!! The fabric feels very close to a regular tshirt, but it doesn't wrinkle and it doesn't look like polyester or spandex (on the white one, in particular). The red and blue are much cheaper looking because of the “neon” look of the colors in person. The red is more of a Christmas red - a slight orange tint. I highly recommend the white (5 stars). Others are ok: Green %26 purple (3.5 stars). Blue %26 red (3 stars if you just wear them around home. 1.5 stars if you expect to add them to your wardrobe.) We got the black, but I don't think I've seen it on her yet and I can't find it for the pic or review.",

I placed my order and waited. Come to find out the product is not coming from a Walmart warehouse but in fact is coming from China directly. My package was delayed/delivered over a week later than originally stated. I waited until the week of Christmas to open the package and check out my purchase and man was I surprised. A few weeks back I had ordered what I thought were a similar pair of slipper for myself on T-E-M-U. They arrived and I opened them the same time I opened the Walmart set. I was beyond annoyed when my six dollar pair of slippers were the EXACT same size same as the set from Walmart that were three times as much. All of that being said, I will review the actual slippers themselves not the shady practices of the third party seller. The slippers are decently cute in person, not as nice looking as they were online. The bottom sole is very strange almost plastic. Would I knowingly purchase this same pair again? Probably not. I think I have had beater luck buying in store at Walmart or Sam’s Club and will go that route from now on.",

The reason that you are getting this burning sensation when you use the product is because you are ALSO using the brush. Cleaning you skin with a brush is also a method of exfoliation, which is NOT a bad thing EXCEPT for when you do that everyday. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE EXFOLIATING EVERYDAY. I strongly recommend to only exfoliate once or twice a week because otherwise in the long run you will be taking a toll on your skin and you will be constantly removing skin cells everyday which will cause you skin to look more aged. The beads in this cleanser are already a gentle exfoliant.",

The old conditioner had a rich texture and made my hair soft for days. This new product sucks, put it on seconds later and it turns to water like. Not worthing the money anymore",

          "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wella Brillance was my holy grail shampoo for years. I usually buy 2 - 1L bottles at a time, so when I received these new ones I was disappointed that they changed completely - formula, smell, and bottle. As disappointing as this was I decided to give it a chance, perhaps the product was actually improved. After two weeks of almost daily use here's how it performed: - The smell is ok if you're into lime, but I'm not a fan. Part of the appeal of the original was how beautiful yet subtle the scent was. - It doesn't lather, I had to use 2X the amount of shampoo to get any decent lather - even then I had to shampoo twice. - My hair has become dull, dry and flat. - It's become incredibly static, it's unreal how much - if I run my hand down the side my hair just lifts up as if I'd rubbed a balloon on it. Just today I was having a conversation outside of my gym and as I was talking I moved my hair off my shoulder and it generated so much static my hair lifted up and then stuck all across my face. It was a little embarrassing, but I laughed it off. My overall experience is that this is one of the worst shampoos I've ever used. It seems as if Wella has essentially created a new product, discontinued an old one, and just piggybacked on the original products' positive reviews and high ratings. They really should have officially discontinued Wells Brilliance and created a new product entirely. It's a shame at what Wella has done with this product. This is a complete fiasco.",

She plays with the sprinkler throughout the summer, and having the door closed is a headache because she cant walk in whenever she wants. Leaving it open is a headache as well, since all the flies and mosquitoes come in as they please. Installation was easy and quick, maybe 15 minutes. I noticed that the Velcro tape didn't stick very well to the paint I had at the door, so I added some staples. There is a lot of magnets down the middle, so it stays shut not allowing any insects in. I can now leave the door open to let fresh air enter without the bugs!",

She put them back into the box and said \" I will take them on our vacation trip in a few weeks\". The week before we left on vacation (September) she got the earbuds out of the little charger box and was listening to them while we started packing, after a few minutes she said \"what's wrong with the screen on the charger box?\" I looked at it and the screen had fallen out in her hand. I understand these earbuds ain't Beats or Apple buds, but I didn't expect the touch screen to fall out before we really had a chance to use them. Maybe it didn't get glued in good at the manufacturer? I don't know... I have the VEATOOL T5 %26 V6 earbuds and they work very well with no issues so far.",

I loved the earbuds but the 2nd one no one could hear me when I was talking so I couldn't use those at all for calls but if I wanna listen to music or something they will work perfectly fine. But I got ear buds for calls when I'm working I don't have to hold my phone on my ear. The bud covers are perfect they fit great holds awesome. The external noise is minimal and the sound is clear. I did not test the frequency range as I kept the box close on my arm or shirt with the string that comes with them you can attach to the box, which is the cooler part about the ear buds to me because I didn't have to put it in my pocket or hold it. All and all these could be the best ear buds but they have a few small kinks to master like the chargers and the volume that goes into the buds. Maybe I'll try them again if they bring out a updated version these.",
