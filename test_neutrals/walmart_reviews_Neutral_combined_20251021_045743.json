Thanks to budget restraints, I am happy to report that my default bias against store brands being lesser quality has been disproven. The Great Value Pure Maple Syrup exceeded my expectations by far as I found the syrup to be of full flavored and rich tasting. I will definitely be placing this item among my list of regular items that I buy monthly, and best part, is I'm enjoying the luxurious taste of Pure Maple syrup, at a ‘ Great Value'.

It smells like fresh pumpkin with undertones of vanilla. The only real downfall is that it is not an overly strong scent. It is not one of those scents that fill the shower when you use it or lingers around afterwards. There are pros and cons to that, especially if you are someone or are around someone who has allergies to scents a lot. I personally wish it was stronger, but it is still a good scent. As a shampoo it is great. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft overall. It lathered well and rinsed out easily. I will say that the pump is not labeled to tell you which way to turn it to unlock it, not a major issue, but something to keep in mind. If you have used native hair products in the past this one is no different. So if the scent sounds good to you I would recommend trying it out, especially with the upcoming fall season.",

This shampoo does a great job at removing the daily buildup of oils and dirt in your hair while also not striping it of all hydration completely. It actually is very effective at cleaning the hair without being striping and instead providing moisture. The scent is a major pro of this shampoo as it has a lovely fall scent of vanilla cream and pumpkin that is so beautiful.

          "title": "Maui Moisture Clarifying Shampoo Review",
          "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Maui Moisture Clarifying Shampoo is a refreshing and effective option for those looking to deep clean their hair and scalp, especially after build-up from styling products, hard water, or excess oil. Formulated with hibiscus water and passionfruit extract, this shampoo is designed to cleanse without stripping away the hair's natural moisture. Packaging and Texture: The shampoo comes in a brightly colored, sturdy plastic bottle with a flip-top cap for easy dispensing. The consistency is a bit on the thicker side, but it lathers up nicely and spreads easily through the hair, requiring only a small amount for a full cleanse. Performance: This clarifying shampoo does an excellent job of removing product buildup, residue, and impurities from the scalp and hair. Despite its clarifying abilities, it doesn’t leave hair feeling dry or overly stripped, which can sometimes be a concern with other deep-cleansing shampoos. The formula gently cleanses while maintaining the hair’s moisture balance, leaving it feeling refreshed and light. Scent: The fragrance is a tropical, fruity blend that’s refreshing without being overwhelming. It lingers subtly on the hair, leaving it smelling clean and fresh. Results: After using the Clarifying Shampoo, hair feels thoroughly cleansed but not stripped or brittle. It’s a great choice for those who regularly use styling products, oils, or dry shampoos, as it clears away residue without compromising the health of your hair. While it’s effective in clearing build-up, it also helps to maintain the softness and manageability of the hair, which makes it a great option for regular use—though, depending on your hair type, you may want to alternate with a gentler shampoo to prevent over-drying. Final Thoughts: The Maui Moisture Clarifying Shampoo is a solid choice for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective way to cleanse their hair. It provides a deep clean without the harshness typical of some clarifying shampoos, and its nourishing ingredients ensure your hair stays hydrated and smooth. Perfect for occasional use to remove buildup and refresh your hair, this shampoo delivers great results without sacrificing moisture or softness.",

          "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the scalp care clarifying shampoo from Maui Moisture and Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I like that I received a full size 13 oz bottle instead of a trial size so I can properly try the product multiple times and form an opinion. The shampoo is in a squeeze bottle, so the product is very easy to dispense. The minty scent of the shampoo is invigorating and helps to make it feel like my scalp is getting clean and any build up is being removed since I typically only wash my hair about 2x a week. Although I feel like I’ve noticed a difference with removing buildup on my scalp, the bottle claims to help prevent hair fall, which I have not noticed a significant improvement in. However, the shampoo bottle says it’s made for all curl types, and I have noticed that my waves/loose curls are much smoother and more defined after using this product line. I would definitely repurchase!",

One of the first ingredients is alcohol which is probably why my hair was dried out. Note: As far as effectiveness, I have thick hair and maybe that’s why it did not work for me.

          "title": "Pantene Moisture Shampoo review",
          "review_text": "Everyone tells you that Pantene is a brand known for its affordable but substandard products but is that true? People look at Pantene and ask “why are there so many ingredients just to do one simple thing?” The question I want to answer is: “are all the ingredients in Pantene's products needed?” My goal here today is to explain what each ingredient is and for you to decide if there are still too many ingredients. The first hair product I researched is the Pantene Moisture Shampoo. There are 16 ingredients (not including water and fragrance) all doing something important. To make this simple, I will be grouping products depending on what they do. The first group is preservatives. They make sure that the hair product doesn't grow mold and bacteria.There are 5 different preservatives: Trisodium citrate Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Tetrasodium EDTA Sodium benzoate Methylisothiazolinone. These 5 ingredients work together to help preserve your shampoo so it is safe to use. If there weren't any preservatives, you could get bacterial breakouts on your scalp and could develop fungal diseases. The second group is different types of conditioners. These are products that help heal and condition hair. There aren't as many conditioning agents in shampoo as there are in conditioner but having them can still drastically impact your hair's health. In this category there are 7 different ingredients: Panthenol Citricum Salicylate Cocamidopropyl Betaine Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride Histidine, Cocamide MEA. These ingredients help counteract the damaging effects of striping your hair of all its oils. Sulfates are amazing cleaning agents because they get rid of everything, putting back moisture and oil will leave your hair not only feeling clean, but also healthy. The last category is cleaning agents. These products are there to help remove dirt and oil. Your scalp constantly creates sebum or oil and if you don't remove it, it will start clogging your hair follicles. This can lead your hair to stop growing . It can also affect how healthy the ends of your hair are because new hair isn't growing. There are 4 ingredients in this group, but 2 of them are there to improve the texture of your hair. These ingredients are Sodium chloride Sodium laureth sulfate Glycol distearate Lauramidopropyl betaine. It is a common misconception that sulfates are bad but if you have ever used shampoo with sulfates you have probably noticed that your hair feels a lot cleaner. You might have even noticed that it looks and feels more healthy. This is because your hair is getting cleaned better. The oil your hair produces is important, but an excess of oils will damage your hair. If you have had better results by using a product that doesn't have any sulfates, then by all means keep on using it. Not all products work the same on everyone, but, if you don't feel like you have been getting a good wash or your hair gets oily really quick, you might think about switching to a shampoo with sulfates. Overall, knowing what is in your hair products and what each ingredient does is super important. I hope you came away from this review knowing that there is a reason for each ingredient that goes into a hair product and not to judge something before you buy it.

I get my brush while conditioner is still in my hair. And I brush through it just like i would if it was dry. I part it like i wear it and brush it back and down . And when I go to rinse it? I use the brush under the water and brush it out as I rinse it. It comes out smooth and silky. And if you think you might still have a bit of conditioner left in it. stand under shower and get your hair like your going to put it up in a ponytail and pull it down to tips of hair.

They effortlessly remove makeup, dirt, and impurities, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The fact that they're plant-based is a huge bonus, as I appreciate products that are gentle on both my skin and the environment. These wipes are super hydrating, which is fantastic for my dry skin. I've noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture and hydration since I started using them. They're also incredibly convenient for on-the-go use or late nights when I'm too tired for a full skincare routine. Overall, I give these wipes a solid 5 stars for their effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and skin-friendly ingredients. Highly recommended!",

The powder is really good for setting any of your makeup, you only need a thin layer to set your makeup and it's effective in combatting shine throughout the day. I found it reduces the LOOK of shine, if halfway y]through the day you feel your face, it will probably FEEL oily it just won't really LOOK oily. It doesn't really diminish the look of fine lines and pores but i guess it makes them look very very slightly smaller. I knocked off one star because this powder is horrible for priming. Do NOT use this BEFORE makeup, it makes your makeup go on patchy and weird, this powder is only really good for setting, the title prime & stay is misleading. overall a good product though, i really like it",

It is much more natural looking. I have extremely oily skin and this hasn't helped Mattify anymore than any other powder but is definitely less candy and feels nice on your skin. Good setting powder although I would be cautious of putting it on dry areas. This powder seems less finely milled or maybe contains less or no silicone than the HD powder.

It is different from the HD Powder and I like it better. I feel like the HD sits on top of my skin whereas this powder isn't visible at all. I have HD in both the white and yellow but I feel like I look like I have rice powder on. I am very fair, mid 40's with average wrinkles and aging. I have used this with and without foundation. I would prefer to not wear foundation but ELF discontinued the mineral line much to my dismay. I am preferring the more natural look of using concealer and this powder and I think I look younger without the heavy makeup. This has no coverage and no color, it just disappears on my face but it gives a more matte finish and makes my face appear smoother. I love being able to put it on throughout the day without ever having to worry about looking chalky or having makeup in my lines. This powder is very soft so beware of dropping it, mine arrived broken but I use it anyway. I apply it with the Ultimate Blending Brush (LOVE!) and it works great. Am buying a few extra to have before they sell out! This works great with foundation and doesn't add any additional color, it also works great without foundation, letting you keep a more natural look without the shine.",

This powder provides great coverage that will last all day. What I like about it , is that it gives a natural look, without leaving a buildup on your skin. I put this on after my foundation, and it looks very pretty and natural. I always apply this with a brush, and the nice thing is, is that you don't need to put on a ton to get good coverage. This is a great match for my light to medium skin tone. I would recommend this product.",

It does fit my window, just barely, and I do not extend the sides at all. It's pretty much impossible to make a bladed fan totally silent, but this is quiet enough, and it moves a decent amount of air. The only reason for the 4-star rating is what they called the \"manual\" reversible feature. What that really means is you take the fan out of the window, turn it around, and put it back in the window. In fairness, it is made to do that. The control is accessible from both sides, and the cord also works both ways. But you would not call it convenient. At this price point I guess you can't expect much more.

I use a wash cloth to wash it away with and it comes off my face is easily as it does my hands. No residue whatsoever. My skin is sensitive as well as \"mature\" and this leaves my skin feeling really nice - not right at all and doesn't stir up any irritation. I really like it. I like the rest of the e.l.f. Holy Hydration products that I've tried too. The moisturizers are really good (the SPF 30 and the gel one in the pump). They're not at all greasy but they moisturize well. No thightness or irritation and my makeup doesn't slide off. The makeup remover is probably the most awesome thing I've used ever. The Holy Hydration line is great. I'll be buying a 3rd bottle of cleanser soon!",

It's rare that I find a cleanser that removes my makeup thoroughly without drying out my skin or causing an eczema flare. Holy Hydration liquid cleanser does a fine job and you can't beat the price! I use this twice a day and have had no issues with breakouts or sensitivity. I only have two (small) gripes about the product. The packaging could use a revamp. A flip-top bottle is not ideal. I found a pump dispenser that fits the neck of the bottle perfectly and solved that problem. The other issue is the scent. It's not offensive, but it is a bet chemical-ish. It's not strong and doesn't linger at all so this is a very minor point, but if it had no discernable fragrance it would be perfection. Still, it's one of the best cleansers I've ever found for my skin. Two thumbs up!",

I have combination skin, usually pretty dry but in my T zone it's oily. This is such a lightly purifying cleanser that is not harsh on the skin. This line is my favourite and forever go too. Highly recommend. The only thing I would change is the packaging. I wish they had a bigger size or at least a pump for it.",

Daily Cleanser and liked that it contained hyaluronic acids that help hydrate the skin and ceramides that keep moisture locked in. I used a dime size amount on makeup free skin and I felt refreshed but not tight or greasy. The gel has wonderful slip and I spent time working in the product and giving myself a mini facial massage. I didn't notice any strong fragrance and my skin was left clean, hydrated and glowing. I have replaced my regular go-to cleanser with this one and I actually prefer this packaging with the snap lid.

I honestly thought it was a flare up. I was just about to try it from the bag again but I'm worried. And I don't want to go trying the other in the jet set bag products if this might have an ingredient that flares up auto immune diseases. Any other products I have zero issues with yet. But this one I'm definitely very hesitant to try from the jet. Set, along with the others. I'll have to research what ingredient it could possibly be. Usually I don't have any bad reactions to e.l.f products. I would recommend maybe if you can return it, refund or get advised to replace it with another product of theirs or get advised on what ingredient it might be but I'm not icon tier yet.",

My 19 year old is now using it on his oily skin and is enjoying it. This one is just not for me.

I have sensitive, combo skin that is maturing (I'm 38, light combo skin, never had any cosmetic procedures/treatments) and it doesn't dry me out, doesn't irritate my skin. My face feels clean and not stripped after I use it. Some cleansers leave my skin feeling tight and dry, but this one doesn't do that. I think this would be good for a lot of different skin types. I've been using elf products since they started and I've been happy with nearly everything since 2004. This is another product I enjoy and will continue to use because it's so gentle on my cranky, finicky skin.",

I'm not a big fan of fragrance in cleansers, but this one has a mild clean scent that didn't bother my sensitive skin too much.",

I got more long term succes if my cell phone is already at 100% and I plug the power bank the whole day so phone battery never drains. In this case current drawn is 0.5A. If I let the cell phone deplete close to zero and plug the power bank to both charge and continue to use the phone, then I might get 1.5 charge during one day. In this case current drawn is 1.8A. Also performance decrese below 12oC (55F) and charge time increase. Below 0oC (32F) it's useless for high drain applications. It might still be usefull for load below 0.5A.",

The size is pocket-friendly, which I like, and it's light enough to carry around in my bag. Overall, it's an okay backup option, but I wouldn't rely on it for heavy use or long trips.

I saw a review from someone who said they had to ask for a new one because the power bank itself wouldn't charge over 60%. After testing it out of the box to see if it could charge my phone, I decided to plug the battery back to charge up it to see if it would charge above 60%. It does! It is now at 80% charged and charging to 100%. Took maybe a couple of hours. So far this is looking like a solid portable power bank.

Ain't no way in heck a 20,000 battery should have gone through 25% of its charge for 5% phone battery. Have 8000mah batteries that gave almost two full charges before being empty. Second, it does not support fast charging or type c to type c charging. Must rely on slower, outdated USB ports. 3rd, both batteries make this God awful whining sound when charging.

The one I have will charge my phone about 2 times, this one wont even charge it past 30%. When using this pack the usb port won't allow you to fully insert the chargers, which is distressing. Not to mention when charging the battery or charging with the battery, it gets unnervingly warm whereas the other 2 I own from different brands don't get warm at all.. For the price it's cheap enough to where I'm not worried about a return or a refund but I wouldn't recommend it, just spend a little bit more and get a battery that is much better quality.

The new formula leaves a streaky residue on my skin, that doesn't go away no matter how long I rub it in. The residue also doesn't mesh well with makeup causing my makeup to separate, crack and ultimately dry out—something I never experienced with the old formula. The old formula left my face feeling moisturized all day long, but the new formula dries out. Overall I'm disappointed with the new formula. If you're going to purchase this face lotion I highly recommend you purchase the old formula. Old formula is 10/10, the new formula is 2/10.",

It works great alone because I've noticed if applied with other products like SPF lotions or serums or a skin protectant, it tends to make cracks in the moisture barrier.

Whenever I apply this product to my face, it feels like it automatically absorbs and makes my face feel cool and moist. To me it feels like my face is plumper and has a bit more glow to it. While, the directions for use state that it can be applied day or night, I prefer it for night use only due to its thicker, cold cream consistency. Even though it blends and absorbs well, I still find it a little too thick for day use. I would purchase this product to balance out my skin routine products because I can definitely feel the moisturizing aspect. I would also recommend this to my friends as an affordable option for moisturizing and pumping the facial derma.",

          "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about this collagen moisture filler from L'oreal. I have been using this lovely moisturizer for several weeks now and I am in love with how this instantly plumps, firms and hydrates my skin, it literally is filling in my fine lines and they appear instantly smoother. My skin is bouncy and firm with a youthful glow!! The collagen is helping my skin retain its natural moisture while adding hydrating qualities from L'Oréal's Purification process, wow!! My skin is deeply hydrated and healthy looking again, all thanks to this collagen filler. I really like that L'Oréal doesn't add any dyes or mineral oils and this moisturizer is not only paraben free but also allergy tested and safe for sensitive skin. From the moment you use this collagen filler you can feel it lock in the moisture, it absorbs quickly, isn't greasy, doesn't clog your pores and gives your skin forty eight hours of moisture. Nothing else that I have used can compare to how incredible this has my skin looking and feeling. I will definitely be purchasing this collagen filler over and over again, it is truly amazing!!",

I remember the large heavy milk glass like jars my mom would have on her dresser and that familiar delicate Pond's fragrance.

All of the blemishes and dark spots are fading and because my skin looks healthier, the wrinkles seem to have faded. I would recommend both of these products to anyone who wants healthier looking and more youthful skin.",

I have other different kinds of moisturizers at home, so I thought they would be as good as Ponds(Lubiderm, Vaseline, Nivea,Aveeno). But my skin never felt lively as it used to be (while using Pond's cold cream). I never had acne., but realized that I see pimple on my cheeks for the first time in my life. I rushed back to store and finally after applying it, I feel my skin got its life back. Thanks Pond's. I wish Pond's do release their facial powder here in US. We get them only in India. Pond's Cold cream and Pond's magic powder are the only make up on my facial skin for over 2 decades.",

Due to hormonal changes, my skin has gotten very dry and I haven't been pleased with my normal moisturizers. So...I was going to get the Pond's with the blue lid for dry skin but decided to give this one a try first. It feels good on my face and my facial skin isn't hurting which is great. The dryness is a big problem so this feels good. But WHY the mineral oil and the parabens? I would feel so much better if a substitute was in this....there are so many good oils to use besides petroleum products, I just don't understand why this is STILL in the Pond's.",

They were both sold out at the time, which is why I opted for this alternative. Won't be buying again.",

It absorbs so quickly and does not leave any greasiness or stickiness. It's not the most hydrating lotion for dry skin, it's more for normal skin. Dry skin really needs a thick cream. It comes out thick but melts into a thin watery lotion like feel. Hours later my skin was so soft. Great for diabetics, like me. Just try it out! Can definitely use on face as all ingredients are safe according to an ingredient check website.",

It's a brand that I trust and I use their facial cleanser on a daily basis. It's a thicker consistency but was easy and smooth to apply. Absorbs well into my skin and doesn't leave it greasy or oily. It is scentless so no smell and is great for those with sensitive noses or to put on or near my face. The tub is a generous size and since a little goes a long way, I can see it lasting me quite a while. If you like a body cream that feels extra nourishing without being heavy, this one's a winner.",

The cream in the jar is very thick & this cream is slightly thinner, but not by much. This cream says it's for your face, neck & chest, but it's a little too thick for my face. I think it depends on your preference, but with the heat & humidity, it's just too thick for my face. I would probably like this more in the winter months.

Does well with a toner on top but I let it absorb first. I love that it's fragrance-free, paraben-free, and hypoallergenic — perfect for me during pregnancy! Great and deep hydration, which is so crucial in our dry state on New Mexico! It actually feels like it helps with firmness and gives my skin a more rested, healthier look. I've been using it daily and already see a difference — especially on days when my skin feels tired or dry. It absorbs well and layers nicely under sunscreen or makeup too.

It has skin activator compounds that penetrate deep to activate sleeping cells that help to firm up the skin. I have only used this a short time and cannot say much about the firming aspect, but there are several other things I noticed and liked. It is a thick formula so it is not messy and it absorbed well into my skin. Since the formula is thicker, you only need a small amount to get the job done. I also personally liked that it had almost no scent to it as well. I have fragrances I like to put on myself and do not like having my lotion compete with them. Overall I am happy with it and my skin is left hydrated and soft after each use.",

After a few days, my skin looked softer and not as dry. It helped my skin feel firmer and more fresh, especially in areas that usually look tired. It has mandelic acid and CICA, which help smooth and calm the skin. There's no strong scent, which I like, and it's gentle enough for sensitive skin. I also love that it's fragrance-free and comes in a nice, easy-to-use jar. Great for daily care!",

With its rich blend of coconut oil and water, it provides deep hydration that leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized for hours. The texture is lightweight and non-greasy, which makes it easy to apply and absorb quickly, perfect for daily use. The subtle coconut scent is refreshing but not overpowering, giving a pleasant tropical feel without being too strong. I also love that it's dermatologist-tested, which reassures me about its quality and suitability for sensitive skin. The 16.8 oz bottle is generously sized and lasts a long time, offering great value. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture—no more dry patches! This lotion is especially good during colder months when my skin tends to dry out more. Overall, Jergens Hydrating Coconut Body Lotion delivers on its promise of hydrating and nourishing the skin, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable solution to combat dryness.",

Applications I use I spent on average 3hrs in the bathroom, and in this day and age, the sun is much warmer than in present years, which means spend more time in the bathrooms, i am managing well in the heat now, where others struggle, the sun can destroy lipids on the skin if not protected 30 plus is now was good in the 80s but to stop it now you need a condenser cream or lotion, this helps preventing cancer on the skin, this all depends what condense skin you have, if not sure I highly recommend to go to a Dermologist before applying any creams or lotions",

I did cleanse and moisturize after. I can tell the difference in my complexion after only 4 days. Love love love this.

          "review_text": "I am a skincare junkie and Elf's skincare is so slept on. Don't even get me started on the Pure Skin line!! SO good. Anyway, I do want to educate people on this product, because I've noticed a lot of the Reviewers don't sewm to understand what's going on here. In Asian skincare, they make exfoliating products called \"Peeling Gels.\" That is definitely where Elf got the inspiration for this product. I love peeling gels SO much. They provide gentle physical exfoliation, and many have fruit acids, PHAs, LHAs, etc to provide a light chemical exfoliation as well. What makes the Elf one stand out is the lotion like consistency when you first apply it, and I love the scent. My complexion is always super smooth and even toned after using this product. For the people who think they are seeing \"so much dead skin coming off\"...that is NOT your skin loves. 😂 That is the cellulose in the product that is intentionally formulated to ball up on itself. That is how the product works lol. The little bits of balled up cellulose are what provide the mechanical exfoliation. Now, obviously some dead skin will be removed..as that's the entire point of an exfoliating product, but 98% of what you are seeing is the product itself. The act of rubbing it in is what causes the product to ball up and exfoliate. I just felt the need to clear that up because it seems that there are a lot of customers who do not understand how this product works and, if you ever have THAT much dead skin balling up and falling off of your face, that would actually be a little concerning lol. Anyway, this product is spectacular and totally worth the price:) ✨️",

I got recommended to try this exfoliant and glad that I tried it.

I also didn't feel like my face actually got a good scrub like my other products which leaves my face feeling soft and glowing.

I have NEVER IN MY LIFE used a products that visibly pulled dead skin off my face. I mean visble clumps of dead skin. Insane!! And there's not a single grain of abrasive beads or sugar in it. It goes on soft like a face cream and as you message it lifts the dead skin and balls it up into little clumps. I used plenty of exfoliating face washes and I've never had this kind of result. BEWARE--- it says gentle, but I was stupid enough to use it 3 times a row to make sure all the dead skin was off....I ended up taking a layer off my nose 😂 the directions on the bottle clearly say to use it 2 or 3 times a WEEK...so I shouldn't have used it 3 times in a row back to back. That was stupid of me. But hey.... more proof it works VERY well. Lol.",

I am in my late 40s and have a light complexion with some sun and age spots and fine lines by the mouth and eyes. I tried out this Gentle Peeling Exfoliant and was impressed by the licorice root, papaya and tangerine extracts. Licorice root helps with dark spots on the skin, papaya helps remove dead skin and tangerine has vitamin C. These are all natural ingredients that together pack a punch for a better complexion without any dryness or excess inflammation. I found that I could tolerate this exfoliant without further irritating my skin and that's the kind of product I was looking for. I used this product once a week for 6 months and I liked how my skin looked calmer and smoother.",

A few uses later and my skin is glowing. I thought I would have to go the rest of my life with my face looking dull and old with the layers of dead skin that was on there. I became really frustrated and just bought this product on a whim to make up the amount for afterpay lol. I didn't think it would really work, but after the first use I was sold. Please ELF, make this fragrance-free and I will be your unofficial ambassador for this product lol.",

I was so disappointed when I went to use it and found out it was a rinse off mask. I've used it about four times since I bought it about 2 weeks ago, and I think I see or at least feel a difference in my skin which is nice.

I pumped some on the tips of my fingers and started lightly rubbing my cheeks. Instantly the dead skin on my face started balling up under my fingers. I rinsed off my face and patted it dry. I can't remember the last time my face felt so clean. I followed up with the Illuminating Moisturizer SPF 15. My skin looks so healthy and feels so soft. Highly recommend this product. It sells out so fast, so get it as soon as you see it in stock. I plan on buying more before I run out.",

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I figured the design HAD to have improved over the last year and a half, right? WRONG. Same issue- except this time the pump didn't work at all.

When I first put it on, I was disappointed, as I thought it would be a scrub like exfoliation, but the end result was nice. It left my face feeling soft. I had my husband (really rough skin) try it. The stuff that thickened (his dead skin or the ingredient, don’t know) was worse than what I got. It was sticking to his face and he couldn’t get it off. He used a foam cleanser to get it off. He said it felt oily. Not sure why we had different reactions to the same product. Maybe it does work some dead skin cells off, I don’t know. Maybe the ingredients didn’t mix well with his oily skin. His skin was super soft afterward compared to his usual sandpaper feel. He needs exfoliation for sure. Overall, satisfied so far, but will see after a few more uses for us both.",

The peeling is now invisible and the product does not cause any irritation. It’s the absolute best “go with” for all Retin A users. It’s important to follow the directions exactly for the best result. One caveat: a little goes a long way This gentle exfoliant is on my “Top Ten” beauty products of all time.

I've noticed fewer breakouts in my problem areas when I use it consistently (every 2-3 days, usually before a shower). It's lasting well even tho I use a pretty liberal amount of it. The spout does clog up if you aren't keeping it clean but only on the outside so just wipe the dried bit off and you're good to go! Don't even have to open it up. I saw a lot of reviews complaining that the product is a scam because it balls up when you rub it in to look like you're sloughing off dead skin but I don't think that's the intension. It's not a trick, the balled up bits are what give your skin the gentle scrub without being harsh or grainy! I believe it is the physical component that helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells. I've also seen people complain about not being able to get the little bits off or it sticking in their peach fuzz. I have never had this problem as I always use my usual face wash (the Elf jelly coconut cleanser ♥! ) afterwards to wash it all off and it works perfectly!",

So, as a scientist who has access to microscopes, I obviously had to find out if this was true! I rubbed some of the cream onto my hand and mounted the balled up things in question onto a slide with some hydrochloric acid. It is largely cellulose! So this is why I deducted a star from my review. I love how this product feels and what it does for my skin but it's pretty clear that the cellulose balling up is misleading consumers. No, it's not sloughing off this much skin every time you use it, which is probably a good thing. But it is a gentle chemical exfoliant which is what I was hoping for.",

I have more to say about trying to get the product out of the bottle than about the actual product itself! After getting it out of the box, I twisted the pump to dispense the product on my hand but after 10-15 pumps, nothing came out. I took the pump off the bottle and noticed that the product was very thick so I decided to shake up the bottle and try again. After several more pumps, no product would come out. I again took the top off and turned the bottle upside down to tap on the palm of my hand to get the product out that way…still a no go. I could hear the product in the bottle as I shook it and it sounded like slurpy jello. I had to take the pump and wiggle the tube around in the product to break it up and then it took a lot to shake out only a few plops of product. At this point, I was so annoyed with all the effort it took to get a dime size amount of the product out, that I did a few quick circles on my cheeks and then washed it off. I should've purchased the travel size that was in a squeeze tube, I'm sure that would've made the product much easier to get out! I won't waste my time with this product again.",

I then only pumped out a small amount onto my first gers to jusy try out on my forehead. I gently rubbed it onto my forehead and the result was instantaneous! I slowly rolled away what was apparently left over residue of my foundation and some dead skin. It looked almost like I had put school glue on and rolled away the residue, but I could feel the tiniest of grainness exfoliating my skin. I tried it Lloyd over my face after my forehead. I the gently washed my face with warm water as instructed. My face felt so smooth and clean! Will buy this product again!",

That didn't help to get rid of all of that dry flaky skin on my face. This does the trick!! It is very mild. No stinging or burning or irritation. You put this on your skin when it is dry, and when you massage it in with your hands, all of that dead skin combines with this and sloughs off, leaving smooth, fresh skin beneath. It is AMAZING. I am 41 years old and my skin is going through some age related changes, and this has not caused me any more issues with this. I love this product. If there was ONE negative thing I HAD to say about it, it would be the smell. It is not gross, but not pleasant either. But it is not a big deal.",

It's always been a very fragile balance between sloughing off enough of the dryness to keep my pores clear (and makeup not looking gross on the uneven surface), and not causing extra irritation in cold/dry weather. This stuff... WORKS. The popular critical review about the clumping agent was almost a relief, since it caused pilling just on my hands and I was terrified of how powerful it seemed. Regardless of the pilling factor being a hoax, my face can be nearly engulfed by flakiness before and then be nearly entirely smooth after use. Without the acne medication so common in other more irritating exfoliants, my skin has been fine using this even three times a week. It /is/ important to apply with dry hands on dry skin, as is listed on the bottle, not with wet skin like the website says. The only drawback is that the pump stopped working after three weeks, and I'll have to attempt transferring it to a tube soon. If it came in a tube instead I would be more than thrilled, but let's be real, I'm already going to be buying this over and over again.",

I read a review on this Walmart product in which the reviewer said her skin was dry until after using this exfoliant and decided to try it- such a good price I couldn't resist! You use a few drops onto either wet or dry skin and \"voila\"! Dry skin sloughs off in tiny balls! I did this 3 times on my face making sure to get close to the hairline and even unto my neck. You rub as directed in small circles then rinse with warm water, dry the skin and repeat I would say no more than 2 times-less if you have sensitive skin. But my skin was so dry that it took 3 repeating rounds to get off all the dry skin. I was left with NEWBORN BABY SOFT SKIN!!! It felt so soft. I applied my usual moisturiser and my skin was still soft 3 days later! The directions say to use 1-2 times per week and I will follow that regime. The results are amazing-no more over-priced exfoliants with tiny beads in them-they do nothing compared to e.l.f. Gentle Peeling Exfoliant! Men and younger people with dry skin would benefit from this product too. I will use it on my hands, neck and upper chest that are my dry skin areas. I am ordering another bottle (even thought I think a whole bottle will last 4-8 weeks at least) just in case e.l.f. decides to raise the price based on these great reviews! Thank you e.l.f. for this great product and all your other products. And thank you Walmart for keeping prices low for hard working Americans.",

ELF is definitely a competitor! I just ordered several skin care products from this line for the first time and this little gem was one of them. It will be a constant in my skin care routine from now on!!! Along with the bounce back jelly cleaner and the mineral face primer, I plan on buying this over and over again. I have fair, sensitive, combination oily/acne prone skin. I have turned my skin red from harsh scrubbing on more than one occasion trying to improve my texture, chemical peels, etc, you name it, I've done it without being too extreme. I tried this product this morning and after one time of using it, I already see a difference. Nothing burned my skin, my skin already looked brighter from the removal of dead skin and looks smoother- before my primer. I plan on using this about twice a week, but girls, if you are looking for a non abrasive option to helping your skin look clear, brighter and smoother and you have oily and sensitive skin???... this is it. Do yourself a favor and try this product. You will not regret it.",

I was used to high end products but lately I've been giving ELF a try and I'm being very pleasantly surprised by their quality. I expected this to be a sticky and grainy-ish type of formula. It is not. It's so smooth, so I liked it right away, even though I was skeptical. I tried it with my fingers, because I wanted to see the product for itself. And OH MY GOODNESS! Right away some small pieces of dead skin already came off. I couldn't believe it! It left my skin feeling so silky, smooth and bright. I've left my face bare after that, no moisturizer or serum, because I wanted to see if it would dry out my skin (I have normal-dry skin and live in a super cold climate). Nope, no dryness at all. This is a tiny miracle. No way I'm spending money on facials with this gold-worth liquid in a bottle. I'm excited to try it out with some mask and the electronic brushes. It's a favorite!",
