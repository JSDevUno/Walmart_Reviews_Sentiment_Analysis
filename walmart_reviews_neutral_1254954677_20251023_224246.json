      "review_text": "I purchased three of these shelving units. So far I have assembled one of the three and placed it in my garage to store various containers of liquids. The shelves look nice and were easy to assemble. While the framing in steel, it is thin steel. It would not be difficult to bend the frame. I didn't expect steel shelving to come in a box labelled \"fragile\". For the under $30 price I paid, the shelves are okay and will server the desired purpose. If you want sturdy, this is not the item to buy. One minor complaint about the fully assemble unit is that the upper half is not actually attached to the lower half. Eventually, I will use eight half inch bolts to secure the upper and lower halves together. I may return the two unopened boxes.",

The shelf board is barely stronger than corrugated cardboard. It's not difficult to assemble by any means though. It's just not what I needed.

I couldn't assembe the upper shelves because connections for metal slots became slightly off from corner dents. I returned it to the store. Examine all parts before you build, if NO DENTS, you could build all five levels. 2 people to assemble. Wood shelves are very thin, so is for very light stuff on each shelf. This is not good for medium or heavy containers. I would say each shelf could hold no more than 10 pounds, like towels, blankets and super light hardware, like light weight Christmas decorations.",

It doesnât feel like âsteelâ more like some type of cheaper metal but its still ok. Thats why i said its overpiced this is worth more like $90.00 not $140. Also i recieved 2 out of 3 of the boxes on one day and the 3rd one the next day! So weird but im not thwnonly one so if that happens to you give it a day.",
