The middle section is not as big, but would still fit smaller tools such as a jigsaw, a sander, etc… plus has a tray for small tools such as a level, tape measure, square etc. This tray can be used in either one of the bottom two sections. The top section is a tray with ten removable compartments for small items such screws, nails, drill bits, etc. Depending on your job need, you have the option to use all three sections at once, only the base section or the base plus one of the other two. The whole system can be rolled around with the help of two solid 7-inch wheels and an extendable handle, a great feature that makes reaching your job site a lot easier especially if you have to go up or down the steps. The top two sections can be released from the storage system and have strong handles so you can carry them away if space is restricted for the whole system. It is worth mentioning that the top tray has a lid that sinks into the ten compartments creating a seal for your items so they don't scatter inside the tray and it is clear so tray contents are visible. Each section interlocks with the section below it for stability while rolling it around and for even more security, the bottom two sections can be locked with padlocks. All three sections come equipped with two strong latches to secure their lids down. If you are a do-it-yourselfer, a craftsman or just need a flexible storage system, The Hart Mobile Tool Storage System is for you. It has a look and feel of high quality construction and presents a variety of storage and organization options depending on your need. Its two wheels and retractable handle allow you to move part or all of the storage system around with ease.",,False,0
