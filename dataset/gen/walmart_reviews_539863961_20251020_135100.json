      "review_text": "It's a nice phone and better than the A01. I ended using it as a emergency car phone in my glove box. I was trying to get the phone unlocked so I can use it on my carrier that uses Verizon towers. It took about 3 hrs tossed and around from person to person to find out it could not work. I even lost service because the first representative said it would help the unlocking process. The last representative said that I agreed to it so I can not get the service back. I also do not like that Verizon prepaid holds the phone hostage until you pay for the first month. That means you can not test the phone out on wifi. I was going to return the phone but the Walmart app said I could not. The only good thing about Verizon prepaid is if a natural Disaster happens they give a free month of service in that area. So now it just emergency phone that can also call 911 because of the voice over lte is happening now.",
