It shuts off multiple times a day and its usually when i pick it up to reply to a text or something. It gives an error that something stopped responding as soon as it powers up. ive put up with it for almost a month but sadly i think I am going to have to switch back to my old phone. 😭 I love the features of the phone and would probably really be happy with it, IF it was working properly.",

Spontaneously failed to receive calls and message notifications from what's up. 4. Quadrupled my contacts with no way to consolidate the copies. I Deleted the copies manually, but in three days extra copies appeared again. Tried to troubleshoot all these issues with no success. Gave it away to a child to use as a toy.

Took off both and bought another screen protector, but the screen was already slightly scratched from the previous ones, and came out uneven and with air pockets. Tried again and again with AT%26T to see if they had the original screen protector, they did not. Previous attempts also made screen even more prone to dust, dirt and smudges. My screen with my third screen protector now is somewhat clear only when there is no direct sunlight, otherwise you can't see what's on the screen because of the glare over the smudges. And nothing seems to clean it off. It's a shame because other than this, it's a good phone",

It will go up to an hour before getting notifications from text or other messaging apps. It will freeze with downloading pages. The camera is awesome. It is just a mixture of great and disappointing all at the same time. I have removed unused apps, i flushed cookies and storage, tried resetting items and nothing has changed it. I will be replacing the phone for a better option. This might be a great phone for someone who does limited smart phone things and just wants a phone for voice calls and run a few apps.",

I have been using my new phone for my day to day use as an IT professional and was a little nervous about choosing this phone when I read some of the reviews but decided to give it a try. I use quite a few apps and multiple email clients and have not experienced any of the issues that have been mentioned in the previous reviews. I get texts fast, emails make it to their destination without issue and call clarity is good. I use Windows, Mac and Linux for my duties and test phones using those platforms. I have not experienced any lag whatsoever. My battery is at 97 percent and I unplugged it over an hour ago. I purchased this phone after my Moto G7 stopped receiving security updates. It replaced my LG G8 thinq that got a cracked screen at work. I have iPhones as well so I know a solid phone when I use it. I decided to purchase this phone because it was a good price point for the features that the phone came with and it also came with a 2 year warranty. I have gotten two software updates since I started to use the phone. Updates are important to me since information security is a must these days. I received a text from ATT that spoke of an update to address some issues that were brought to their attention and advised to update the phone but I had already performed the update a week prior.",

Everything else about this phone is solid; the screen, responsiveness, and battery are all pretty good given the price.

Had a couple of their phones back in the day when cell phones first came out (yes, I'm that old...lol) and they were garbage then and their garbage now. Pretty typical from what I've come to expect from Alcatel. Phone freezes routinely or lags. I tried calling Customer Service at first and all they could say was \"Try turning it off for ten minutes and turning it back on.\" It usually didn't help. I've had this phone for 6 months now and out of all the past phones I've owned (including past Alcatel phones) this one has been the worse! Apps routinely freeze up causing me to have to stop and restart the phone. I keep the number of apps I have to a minimum thinking this would help, but not so. Spend the money and get a good quality phone like Samsungs. You'll only cry once.",

It has a large display and is very bright. It's fast and I have no issues playing my games. ( Games like Wonka world and mystery object games)..I have not tried any power demanding games that require higher resources to run them though and with 4 gigs of ram you may be disappointed in doing so. This is definitely not a gaming phone but I have found it quite snappy for everyday casual game playing. The speaker isn't bad either. Overall, I recommend this phone to someone on a budget.",

The store I bought it from was out of the Motorola 5G. I wish I had gone to a different store and not bought this phone. I look forward to buying a new phone so I can smash this one to thousands of pieces. Atnt should refund every person that purchased this sorry phone. Do not buy this phone for any reason.",
