He is tall and says that these joggers have a very good length they're not too baggy, they're roomy in the waist, but it has adequate elastic as well as as a drawstring. He likes the cargo pockets on the side, which are very large as well as side pockets in the front. There are no pockets in the back, but that was fine. The material is stretchy.

He's usually a medium, but the medium fit more like a roomy large-he probably needed a small. The color is actually quite nice, but that's where the compliments end. For the price, they don't feel worth it. The material is thick and the cut is bulky, which made them look a bit clunky and not very stylish. He said they felt more like utility wear than something he'd want to wear casually. Maybe they'd work better in colder weather, but overall, he wasn't impressed and would rather try a different pair.",
