      "review_text": "the phone is well built, its heavy but it feels like it built with durable materials, the chassis is nice. it boots up slowly, but the screen is nice and the system has 3GB of RAM so it can run most apps. the processor isnt the greatest, but if you are using the phone for basic functions, apps, streaming music, streaming video, email, talk and text, its really as good as any other phone. the battery charges slowly and is only 3000 Mah, some phones have twice the battery capacity. the best solution is to buy a 10K mah external battery unit, between the phone and an external battery you can get two days heavy use out if the phone. i bought a cheap rubber case on amazon for ten dollars and it fit perfectly, have dropped the phone more than a few times and the screen hasnt cracked. I have had the phone for six months now, use it everyday and its still going strong. the native FM radio app needs an update but ither than that all the sofrware has worked well. best value for the price,",

My wife was attacked by two men last nightwhile leaving the grocery store and the phone glitched out and decided it wanted to reboot while she was trying to dial 911. The assailants had time ebough to locate a rock and bust out her window, A CAR WINDOW!! It took several blows to do that. They punched her in the face, broke her nose, grabbed her purse snd ran. WOW!! Yeah not everyone can get a new super phone. No, some,like my wife and i, who have 7 kids, and not 2 pennies to rub together, especially at Christmas time, have to settle for this phone thst doesnt work when you need iit most.
