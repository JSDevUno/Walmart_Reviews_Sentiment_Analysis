      "title": "This is more of a light-duty mouse",
      "review_text": "I remember when an optical mouse became available. Before then, every few days I'd have to pop the mouse ball out of the mouse, cleaning it and the rollers because it would eventually build up with crap on the rollers making the mouse move erratically. Years later, after my mousepad wore out, I decided I'd try this mouse out since the \"mouse\" itself doesn't move... it's just a matter of rolling around the little mouse ball. What a difference between an optical mouse and a mouse with a ball. I have a 6 year old autistic son, I work out of the house, and I tend to him multiple times a day washing my hands frequently. Even so, after about 2 days, same thing happens with this mouse as did the mouse ball back in the day... the ball builds crud up on it transferring the crud to the internal rollers... having the mouse pointer then move erratically and not smooth. Also, if you need precision with your mouse... easily and quickly clicking somewhere (like in the center of a word), this mouse is no good. After a few weeks of using it, it has cost me time... trying to get the mouse exactly where I'm wanting it. A mouse that moves, if you have your hand/finger on it but not moving the mouse, the mouse pointer won't move. You can't do that with this \"mouse.\" Have your finger on the ball... trying to get it right between 2 letters to click... it's jumpy... part of it is because of the crud the mouse ball picks up. This mouse is okay if you don't use it a lot... but if what you do on the computer involves using the mouse a lot with precision, this isn't the mouse for you. It is very hard to get this mouse/mouse pointer positioned precisely. Something else with this mouse are the buttons, or at least that right mouse button is very soft and I'm continually clicking it (without meaning to). Limited computer use, limited mouse use... this mouse is okay for that. But if you use the mouse a lot and need to precisely place the cursor... this isn't the mouse for you. And having to clean the mouse ball every 2 days or so... just can't do it. With an optical mouse, it's extremely easy to position the mouse pointer between 2 letters then clicking. It is time consuming and difficult to do that with this mouse... and as a programmer who continually needs to place the mouse with precision wherever I'm wanting it... this mouse has been a headache. I'm done cleaning mouse balls... ordered an optical mouse and am back to using it.",
