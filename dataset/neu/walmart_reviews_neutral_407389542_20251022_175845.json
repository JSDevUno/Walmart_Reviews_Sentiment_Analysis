What I don't like is how turning it on and off requires the power button to be held down for about two seconds and the button is sunk into the shell rather than being raised to make it easier to find and press. Having the UPS on the floor works better to save desk space, so using my foot to operate the power button saves bending over, but the design makes this less convenient.",

Even more critical is not losing data or days of work due to power outages. I vowed the last time that happened, during an ice storm when the electricity was out for days, that I would invest in a universal power supply. But I could never justify the cost for something that only gets used every now and then. But this battery backup is so affordable, I can't afford not to have it in my home office. My internet modem, computer, and monitor all can be plugged into it so that if, or should I say when the power goes out again -- and it will -- I now have the ability to finish and save my work in progress, upload it safely, and shut everything down properly. Those few extra minutes can potentially save days of work. It's peace of mind at an affordable price. A must-have for anyone who works from home, yet powerful enough for a small office too. Also allows me to charge my phone fully while I still can.",

      "review_text": "For me, a backup has to support a router, phone, external HDs, PC, and monitor to support a tidy shutdown in case of power failure. I also wanted surge protection for a printer, scanner and occasional camera. There are enough receptacles to satisfy those requirements. The only difficulty would be if I increased the devices needing backup because - as always - manufacturers don't even try to follow a standard orientation of power adapters. That means one adapter is taking up one slot and covering up the adjacent one preventing it being used. But that's a potential problem for most backups of this type. It's not a problem yet. I can't comment on the way it works with the PowerPanel management software because I don't want it hooked up and running on my computer. Certainly for an off-the-shelf unit for home use, it's satisfactory. I hope to never find out that it's otherwise.",
