The only difficulty would be if I increased the devices needing backup because - as always - manufacturers don't even try to follow a standard orientation of power adapters. That means one adapter is taking up one slot and covering up the adjacent one preventing it being used. But that's a potential problem for most backups of this type. It's not a problem yet.

The power in her apartment frequently goes out whenever it storms there, so on several occasions over the years she's found herself suddenly suffocating in the dark and forced to try to open a portable oxygen cylinder with arthritic hands. She has never owned a computer and has no need for one, but her oxygen concentrator draws a significant amount of power. The 900 V/A UPS that I use for my computer only lasted 6 minutes under that load, so after some research I settled on this product. This battery backup still only lasts for 15-20 minutes, so it will not provide continuous power through most blackouts, but it gives her enough time for either neighbors, family, or emergency services to check on her and open an oxygen tank or plug the oxygen machine into a generator with an extension cord. The battery alarm will also immediately let her know she needs help if the power goes out in the middle of the night rather than violently coughing herself awake, which is how she used to find out. This device was put to the test less than a month after I put it in her home. She initially panicked when the lights went out, but realized after 30 seconds that she could still breathe. The UPS worked exactly the way I hoped it would. She was able to remain calm and safe until help arrived. I recommend anyone with elderly relatives to consider something like this as an option, but you will need to do some math first and make sure the volts / amps / watts on whatever you're plugging into it will last long enough on battery power to suit your purposes.",,False,0

Before then, every few days I'd have to pop the mouse ball out of the mouse, cleaning it and the rollers because it would eventually build up with crap on the rollers making the mouse move erratically. Years later, after my mousepad wore out, I decided I'd try this mouse out since the ""mouse"" itself doesn't move... it's just a matter of rolling around the little mouse ball. What a difference between an optical mouse and a mouse with a ball. I have a 6 year old autistic son, I work out of the house, and I tend to him multiple times a day washing my hands frequently. Even so, after about 2 days, same thing happens with this mouse as did the mouse ball back in the day... the ball builds crud up on it transferring the crud to the internal rollers... having the mouse pointer then move erratically and not smooth. Also, if you need precision with your mouse... easily and quickly clicking somewhere (like in the center of a word), this mouse is no good. After a few weeks of using it, it has cost me time... trying to get the mouse exactly where I'm wanting it. A mouse that moves, if you have your hand/finger on it but not moving the mouse, the mouse pointer won't move. You can't do that with this ""mouse."" Have your finger on the ball... trying to get it right between 2 letters to click... it's jumpy... part of it is because of the crud the mouse ball picks up. This mouse is okay if you don't use it a lot... but if what you do on the computer involves using the mouse a lot with precision, this isn't the mouse for you. It is very hard to get this mouse/mouse pointer positioned precisely. Something else with this mouse are the buttons, or at least that right mouse button is very soft and I'm continually clicking it (without meaning to). Limited computer use, limited mouse use... this mouse is okay for that. But if you use the mouse a lot and need to precisely place the cursor... this isn't the mouse for you. And having to clean the mouse ball every 2 days or so... just can't do it. With an optical mouse, it's extremely easy to position the mouse pointer between 2 letters then clicking. It is time consuming and difficult to do that with this mouse... and as a programmer who continually needs to place the mouse with precision wherever I'm wanting it... this mouse has been a headache. I'm done cleaning mouse balls... ordered an optical mouse and am back to using it.",,False,0

Most bags come with at least a side compartment/pocket for accessories such as power supply, cables and mice. I have a fairly expensive full-sized mouse that I use at home, and if I take it with me when I travel, it sticks out like a fist in the side of the bag. This Onn Wireless Travel Mouse solves that issue for me. It is smaller, yet not so small that it is hard for an adult to use. The light grey/black color makes it easy to spot on a dark finish desk or table. At 1600 DPI, it is more sensitive than my full sized mouse (1000 DPI) and has 3 buttons (one is scroll wheel to the right only) in addition to a knurled scroll wheel which I like because my finger doesn't slip on it. It has an on/off switch on the bottom along with a ""connect"" button that I have not had to utilize so far. It comes with 2 AAA Energizer batteries instead of the usual ""off"" brands that other manufacturers provide. The top comes off easily to access the batteries and storage area for the receiver. I have been using this mouse for a week now, and there is nothing I don't like about it. It is well made, feels solid, and is comfortable to use. This not a ""quiet"" mouse, but for the price it is a great deal. It is too early to evaluate the durability of the mouse, or the battery life, but I have other electronics made by Onn, and they are still going strong after a few years, so I expect a long working life for this mouse.",,False,0
