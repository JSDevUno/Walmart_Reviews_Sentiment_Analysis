There is dry skin cells coming off but that isn't what you're seeing. This stuff works great, is just as good as the more expensive face washes in the same style and left my skin primed and ready for the face mask i used after! And it's only $10!!

Anyway, I do want to educate people on this product, because I've noticed a lot of the Reviewers don't sewm to understand what's going on here. In Asian skincare, they make exfoliating products called \"Peeling Gels.\" That is definitely where Elf got the inspiration for this product. I love peeling gels SO much. They provide gentle physical exfoliation, and many have fruit acids, PHAs, LHAs, etc to provide a light chemical exfoliation as well. What makes the Elf one stand out is the lotion like consistency when you first apply it, and I love the scent. My complexion is always super smooth and even toned after using this product. For the people who think they are seeing \"so much dead skin coming off\"...that is NOT your skin loves. 😂 That is the cellulose in the product that is intentionally formulated to ball up on itself. That is how the product works lol. The little bits of balled up cellulose are what provide the mechanical exfoliation. Now, obviously some dead skin will be removed..as that's the entire point of an exfoliating product, but 98% of what you are seeing is the product itself. The act of rubbing it in is what causes the product to ball up and exfoliate. I just felt the need to clear that up because it seems that there are a lot of customers who do not understand how this product works and, if you ever have THAT much dead skin balling up and falling off of your face, that would actually be a little concerning lol. Anyway, this product is spectacular and totally worth the price:) ✨️",

I have tried it 2X, thinking maybe the first time it was just because it is an unfamiliar product but, nope, still had to hold my breath. I also didn't feel like my face actually got a good scrub like my other products which leaves my face feeling soft and glowing. I'll see if a friend may want to give it a try but otherwise, I will have to trash it. So disappointed.",

I have NEVER IN MY LIFE used a products that visibly pulled dead skin off my face. I mean visble clumps of dead skin. Insane!! And there's not a single grain of abrasive beads or sugar in it. It goes on soft like a face cream and as you message it lifts the dead skin and balls it up into little clumps. I used plenty of exfoliating face washes and I've never had this kind of result. BEWARE--- it says gentle, but I was stupid enough to use it 3 times a row to make sure all the dead skin was off....I ended up taking a layer off my nose 😂 the directions on the bottle clearly say to use it 2 or 3 times a WEEK...so I shouldn't have used it 3 times in a row back to back. That was stupid of me. But hey.... more proof it works VERY well. Lol.",

I am in my late 40s and have a light complexion with some sun and age spots and fine lines by the mouth and eyes. I tried out this Gentle Peeling Exfoliant and was impressed by the licorice root, papaya and tangerine extracts. Licorice root helps with dark spots on the skin, papaya helps remove dead skin and tangerine has vitamin C. These are all natural ingredients that together pack a punch for a better complexion without any dryness or excess inflammation. I found that I could tolerate this exfoliant without further irritating my skin and that's the kind of product I was looking for. I used this product once a week for 6 months and I liked how my skin looked calmer and smoother.",

But other than that this product is the holy grail of exfoliators for me. I've been using Paula's Choice BHA & AHA products which many people consider holy grails, but the first use of the elf exfoliator removed more dead skin than Paula's Choice ever removed in the many months I've been using them. A few uses later and my skin is glowing. I thought I would have to go the rest of my life with my face looking dull and old with the layers of dead skin that was on there. I became really frustrated and just bought this product on a whim to make up the amount for afterpay lol. I didn't think it would really work, but after the first use I was sold. Please ELF, make this fragrance-free and I will be your unofficial ambassador for this product lol.",

I read one of the comments below about this just being cellulose but I don't believe that. I tested the theory by trying it a second time shortly after and nothing balled up.

It's added as biodegradable replacement for the plastic microbeads the cosmetic industry used to use as scrubbing agents, because now we know those beads are filling up our oceans.

When I first put it on, I was disappointed, as I thought it would be a scrub like exfoliation, but the end result was nice. It left my face feeling soft. I had my husband (really rough skin) try it. The stuff that thickened (his dead skin or the ingredient, don’t know) was worse than what I got. It was sticking to his face and he couldn’t get it off. He used a foam cleanser to get it off. He said it felt oily. Not sure why we had different reactions to the same product. Maybe it does work some dead skin cells off, I don’t know. Maybe the ingredients didn’t mix well with his oily skin. His skin was super soft afterward compared to his usual sandpaper feel. He needs exfoliation for sure. Overall, satisfied so far, but will see after a few more uses for us both.",

I've noticed fewer breakouts in my problem areas when I use it consistently (every 2-3 days, usually before a shower). It's lasting well even tho I use a pretty liberal amount of it. The spout does clog up if you aren't keeping it clean but only on the outside so just wipe the dried bit off and you're good to go! Don't even have to open it up. I saw a lot of reviews complaining that the product is a scam because it balls up when you rub it in to look like you're sloughing off dead skin but I don't think that's the intension. It's not a trick, the balled up bits are what give your skin the gentle scrub without being harsh or grainy! I believe it is the physical component that helps to exfoliate the dead skin cells. I've also seen people complain about not being able to get the little bits off or it sticking in their peach fuzz. I have never had this problem as I always use my usual face wash (the Elf jelly coconut cleanser ♥! ) afterwards to wash it all off and it works perfectly!",

So, as a scientist who has access to microscopes, I obviously had to find out if this was true! I rubbed some of the cream onto my hand and mounted the balled up things in question onto a slide with some hydrochloric acid. It is largely cellulose! So this is why I deducted a star from my review. I love how this product feels and what it does for my skin but it's pretty clear that the cellulose balling up is misleading consumers. No, it's not sloughing off this much skin every time you use it, which is probably a good thing. But it is a gentle chemical exfoliant which is what I was hoping for.",

I have more to say about trying to get the product out of the bottle than about the actual product itself! After getting it out of the box, I twisted the pump to dispense the product on my hand but after 10-15 pumps, nothing came out. I took the pump off the bottle and noticed that the product was very thick so I decided to shake up the bottle and try again. After several more pumps, no product would come out. I again took the top off and turned the bottle upside down to tap on the palm of my hand to get the product out that way…still a no go. I could hear the product in the bottle as I shook it and it sounded like slurpy jello. I had to take the pump and wiggle the tube around in the product to break it up and then it took a lot to shake out only a few plops of product. At this point, I was so annoyed with all the effort it took to get a dime size amount of the product out, that I did a few quick circles on my cheeks and then washed it off. I should've purchased the travel size that was in a squeeze tube, I'm sure that would've made the product much easier to get out! I won't waste my time with this product again.",

Afterwards, I really feel like my skin absorbs the hydrating serum and daily moisturizers SO much better! I have worked this into my skincare routine 2-3 times a week, and haven't even had to wear foundation these last few weeks. I am overly pleased!",

      "review_text": "I have terribly dry skin, with uncontrollable amounts of flaking in the winter. It's always been a very fragile balance between sloughing off enough of the dryness to keep my pores clear (and makeup not looking gross on the uneven surface), and not causing extra irritation in cold/dry weather. This stuff... WORKS. The popular critical review about the clumping agent was almost a relief, since it caused pilling just on my hands and I was terrified of how powerful it seemed. Regardless of the pilling factor being a hoax, my face can be nearly engulfed by flakiness before and then be nearly entirely smooth after use. Without the acne medication so common in other more irritating exfoliants, my skin has been fine using this even three times a week. It /is/ important to apply with dry hands on dry skin, as is listed on the bottle, not with wet skin like the website says. The only drawback is that the pump stopped working after three weeks, and I'll have to attempt transferring it to a tube soon. If it came in a tube instead I would be more than thrilled, but let's be real, I'm already going to be buying this over and over again.",

It has very little smell (if any), which is a plus because I am sensitive to fragrances. It leaves my face feeling so smooth and shiny, which I personally like. After having two facials in the last year and both estheticians telling me I have great skin but need to exfoliate more often, I finally listened and added this product to my routine.

I read a review on this Walmart product in which the reviewer said her skin was dry until after using this exfoliant and decided to try it- such a good price I couldn't resist! You use a few drops onto either wet or dry skin and \"voila\"! Dry skin sloughs off in tiny balls! I did this 3 times on my face making sure to get close to the hairline and even unto my neck. You rub as directed in small circles then rinse with warm water, dry the skin and repeat I would say no more than 2 times-less if you have sensitive skin. But my skin was so dry that it took 3 repeating rounds to get off all the dry skin. I was left with NEWBORN BABY SOFT SKIN!!! It felt so soft. I applied my usual moisturiser and my skin was still soft 3 days later! The directions say to use 1-2 times per week and I will follow that regime. The results are amazing-no more over-priced exfoliants with tiny beads in them-they do nothing compared to e.l.f. Gentle Peeling Exfoliant! Men and younger people with dry skin would benefit from this product too. I will use it on my hands, neck and upper chest that are my dry skin areas. I am ordering another bottle (even thought I think a whole bottle will last 4-8 weeks at least) just in case e.l.f. decides to raise the price based on these great reviews! Thank you e.l.f. for this great product and all your other products. And thank you Walmart for keeping prices low for hard working Americans.",

I LOVE me some luxury skin care products, but also like to save where I can and really...the beauty market has changed a lot and the results we are getting with the expensive lines, the more affordable lines are bringing their A game to compete. ELF is definitely a competitor! I just ordered several skin care products from this line for the first time and this little gem was one of them. It will be a constant in my skin care routine from now on!!! Along with the bounce back jelly cleaner and the mineral face primer, I plan on buying this over and over again. I have fair, sensitive, combination oily/acne prone skin. I have turned my skin red from harsh scrubbing on more than one occasion trying to improve my texture, chemical peels, etc, you name it, I've done it without being too extreme. I tried this product this morning and after one time of using it, I already see a difference. Nothing burned my skin, my skin already looked brighter from the removal of dead skin and looks smoother- before my primer. I plan on using this about twice a week, but girls, if you are looking for a non abrasive option to helping your skin look clear, brighter and smoother and you have oily and sensitive skin???... this is it. Do yourself a favor and try this product. You will not regret it.",

I was used to high end products but lately I've been giving ELF a try and I'm being very pleasantly surprised by their quality. I expected this to be a sticky and grainy-ish type of formula. It is not. It's so smooth, so I liked it right away, even though I was skeptical. I tried it with my fingers, because I wanted to see the product for itself. And OH MY GOODNESS! Right away some small pieces of dead skin already came off. I couldn't believe it! It left my skin feeling so silky, smooth and bright. I've left my face bare after that, no moisturizer or serum, because I wanted to see if it would dry out my skin (I have normal-dry skin and live in a super cold climate). Nope, no dryness at all. This is a tiny miracle. No way I'm spending money on facials with this gold-worth liquid in a bottle. I'm excited to try it out with some mask and the electronic brushes. It's a favorite!",
