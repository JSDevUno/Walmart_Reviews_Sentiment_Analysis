      "review_text": "Jergens Hydrating Coconut Body Lotion is a game-changer for anyone dealing with dry skin. With its rich blend of coconut oil and water, it provides deep hydration that leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized for hours. The texture is lightweight and non-greasy, which makes it easy to apply and absorb quickly, perfect for daily use. The subtle coconut scent is refreshing but not overpowering, giving a pleasant tropical feel without being too strong. I also love that it's dermatologist-tested, which reassures me about its quality and suitability for sensitive skin. The 16.8 oz bottle is generously sized and lasts a long time, offering great value. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in my skin's texture—no more dry patches! This lotion is especially good during colder months when my skin tends to dry out more. Overall, Jergens Hydrating Coconut Body Lotion delivers on its promise of hydrating and nourishing the skin, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable solution to combat dryness.",

Applications I use I spent on average 3hrs in the bathroom, and in this day and age, the sun is much warmer than in present years, which means spend more time in the bathrooms, i am managing well in the heat now, where others struggle, the sun can destroy lipids on the skin if not protected 30 plus is now was good in the 80s but to stop it now you need a condenser cream or lotion, this helps preventing cancer on the skin, this all depends what condense skin you have, if not sure I highly recommend to go to a Dermologist before applying any creams or lotions",
