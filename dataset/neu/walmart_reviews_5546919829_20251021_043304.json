The next thing I noticed was how smooth it felt as I applied it. It has a very silky feel that absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. My skin has not had any breakouts or any other irritations. It even seems to have begun smoothing out the skin on my neck in the areas I have some sun damage.

Whenever I apply this product to my face, it feels like it automatically absorbs and makes my face feel cool and moist. To me it feels like my face is plumper and has a bit more glow to it. While, the directions for use state that it can be applied day or night, I prefer it for night use only due to its thicker, cold cream consistency. Even though it blends and absorbs well, I still find it a little too thick for day use.

My skin is bouncy and firm with a youthful glow!! The collagen is helping my skin retain its natural moisture while adding hydrating qualities from L'Oréal's Purification process, wow!! My skin is deeply hydrated and healthy looking again, all thanks to this collagen filler. I really like that L'Oréal doesn't add any dyes or mineral oils and this moisturizer is not only paraben free but also allergy tested and safe for sensitive skin. From the moment you use this collagen filler you can feel it lock in the moisture, it absorbs quickly, isn't greasy, doesn't clog your pores and gives your skin forty eight hours of moisture. Nothing else that I have used can compare to how incredible this has my skin looking and feeling. I will definitely be purchasing this collagen filler over and over again, it is truly amazing!!",
