Beside from smelling nice for so long it helped detangle my hair and made it so soft. However, they changed to a new formula and this new product looks like it thinner textured and my hair isn't as soft as it feels as the old product. The conditioner formula is even worse! The old conditioner had a rich texture and made my hair soft for days. This new product sucks, put it on seconds later and it turns to water like. Not worthing the money anymore",

Ever since then, I have religiously used Wella shampoo and NOTHING else. Nearly ten years! It kept my hair vivid and healthy. When I ran out of my stockpile, I could only find Invigo everywhere, and gave it a try. Not only does it smell absolutely horrible, but my hair is waxy and I can SEE the color being shed from my hair in the shower. Really hoping they revert back to the old formula soon. Massively disappointing.",

It was the only shampoo/conditioner I had found that not only worked best for my hair, but had a pleasant and not overpowering scent. I am very sensitive to odors. I only use unscented deodorant, laundry soap, etc. I cannot tell you how this product works because I could not even use it. The scent is awful and too strong. I have returned the product and am on the search for a new shampoo. Please bring the old formula back. You have unfortunately lost a loyal customer. :(",

      "title": "A COMPLETE FIASCO",
      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wella Brillance was my holy grail shampoo for years. I usually buy 2 - 1L bottles at a time, so when I received these new ones I was disappointed that they changed completely - formula, smell, and bottle. As disappointing as this was I decided to give it a chance, perhaps the product was actually improved. After two weeks of almost daily use here's how it performed: - The smell is ok if you're into lime, but I'm not a fan. Part of the appeal of the original was how beautiful yet subtle the scent was. - It doesn't lather, I had to use 2X the amount of shampoo to get any decent lather - even then I had to shampoo twice. - My hair has become dull, dry and flat. - It's become incredibly static, it's unreal how much - if I run my hand down the side my hair just lifts up as if I'd rubbed a balloon on it. Just today I was having a conversation outside of my gym and as I was talking I moved my hair off my shoulder and it generated so much static my hair lifted up and then stuck all across my face. It was a little embarrassing, but I laughed it off. My overall experience is that this is one of the worst shampoos I've ever used. It seems as if Wella has essentially created a new product, discontinued an old one, and just piggybacked on the original products' positive reviews and high ratings. They really should have officially discontinued Wells Brilliance and created a new product entirely. It's a shame at what Wella has done with this product. This is a complete fiasco.",

However, this new formula for Normal/Fine hair does not lather or retain color as well and it leaves my hair feeling hard/difficult to style. Also, the smell is not as pleasant. I'm sorry to say that although I have loved all the Wella products that I have used in the past, I cannot continue to use this new product formula and will be looking for a new line of Shampoo and Conditioner to try.",
