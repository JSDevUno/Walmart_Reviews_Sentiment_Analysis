      "title": "VEAT00L A9 ANC ENC touch screen fell out.",
      "review_text": "I purchased these VEAT00L A9 ANC ENC Earbuds with Smart Touch Screen on August 17th. I gave them to my wife, she really liked the sound and the fit was good. She put them back into the box and said \" I will take them on our vacation trip in a few weeks\". The week before we left on vacation (September) she got the earbuds out of the little charger box and was listening to them while we started packing, after a few minutes she said \"what's wrong with the screen on the charger box?\" I looked at it and the screen had fallen out in her hand. I understand these earbuds ain't Beats or Apple buds, but I didn't expect the touch screen to fall out before we really had a chance to use them. Maybe it didn't get glued in good at the manufacturer? I don't know... I have the VEATOOL T5 %26 V6 earbuds and they work very well with no issues so far.",

      "review_text": "I ordered 2 of these ear buds within 2 weeks of each other. The 1st wouldn't charge which I found out the chargers in both did not charge the box it needs a stronger charger to charge it, so I sent the 1st one back the sound and everything was fine. I loved the earbuds but the 2nd one no one could hear me when I was talking so I couldn't use those at all for calls but if I wanna listen to music or something they will work perfectly fine. But I got ear buds for calls when I'm working I don't have to hold my phone on my ear. The bud covers are perfect they fit great holds awesome. The external noise is minimal and the sound is clear. I did not test the frequency range as I kept the box close on my arm or shirt with the string that comes with them you can attach to the box, which is the cooler part about the ear buds to me because I didn't have to put it in my pocket or hold it. All and all these could be the best ear buds but they have a few small kinks to master like the chargers and the volume that goes into the buds. Maybe I'll try them again if they bring out a updated version these.",
