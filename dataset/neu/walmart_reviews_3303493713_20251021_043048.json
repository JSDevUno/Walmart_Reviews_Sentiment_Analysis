I got more long term succes if my cell phone is already at 100% and I plug the power bank the whole day so phone battery never drains. In this case current drawn is 0.5A. If I let the cell phone deplete close to zero and plug the power bank to both charge and continue to use the phone, then I might get 1.5 charge during one day. In this case current drawn is 1.8A. Also performance decrese below 12oC (55F) and charge time increase. Below 0oC (32F) it's useless for high drain applications. It might still be usefull for load below 0.5A.",

      "review_text": "It Gets the Job Done, But Nothing Special I bought this power bank mainly for traveling and daily backup charging. It works fine for the most part — it charges my phone about 1.5 times on a full charge, which is decent but not amazing for the size. It's not the fastest when it comes to recharging itself either, so you have to plan ahead. The build quality is alright — feels a bit plasticky but hasn't given me any trouble so far. The size is pocket-friendly, which I like, and it's light enough to carry around in my bag. Overall, it's an okay backup option, but I wouldn't rely on it for heavy use or long trips. If you just need something basic for emergencies, this does the trick. --- If you'd like, I can tailor it to a specific model or your actual experience — just let me know!",

I saw a review from someone who said they had to ask for a new one because the power bank itself wouldn't charge over 60%. After testing it out of the box to see if it could charge my phone, I decided to plug the battery back to charge up it to see if it would charge above 60%. It does! It is now at 80% charged and charging to 100%. Took maybe a couple of hours. So far this is looking like a solid portable power bank.

Ain't no way in heck a 20,000 battery should have gone through 25% of its charge for 5% phone battery. Have 8000mah batteries that gave almost two full charges before being empty. Second, it does not support fast charging or type c to type c charging. Must rely on slower, outdated USB ports. 3rd, both batteries make this God awful whining sound when charging.

I purchased a battery with half the capacity as this one a few years ago for a little bit more money and it lasts longer and is much better quality. The one I have will charge my phone about 2 times, this one wont even charge it past 30%. When using this pack the usb port won't allow you to fully insert the chargers, which is distressing. Not to mention when charging the battery or charging with the battery, it gets unnervingly warm whereas the other 2 I own from different brands don't get warm at all.. For the price it's cheap enough to where I'm not worried about a return or a refund but I wouldn't recommend it, just spend a little bit more and get a battery that is much better quality. I thought I was getting a huge deal buying this item \"on sale\" but I really just ended up paying more than it's worth.",
