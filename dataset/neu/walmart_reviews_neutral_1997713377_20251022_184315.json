      "title": "My choice for traveling",
      "review_text": "I have used wireless mice with my laptops for many years now, and always use a laptop computer bag when traveling. Most bags come with at least a side compartment/pocket for accessories such as power supply, cables and mice. I have a fairly expensive full-sized mouse that I use at home, and if I take it with me when I travel, it sticks out like a fist in the side of the bag. This Onn Wireless Travel Mouse solves that issue for me. It is smaller, yet not so small that it is hard for an adult to use. The light grey/black color makes it easy to spot on a dark finish desk or table. At 1600 DPI, it is more sensitive than my full sized mouse (1000 DPI) and has 3 buttons (one is scroll wheel to the right only) in addition to a knurled scroll wheel which I like because my finger doesn't slip on it. It has an on/off switch on the bottom along with a \"connect\" button that I have not had to utilize so far. It comes with 2 AAA Energizer batteries instead of the usual \"off\" brands that other manufacturers provide. The top comes off easily to access the batteries and storage area for the receiver. I have been using this mouse for a week now, and there is nothing I don't like about it. It is well made, feels solid, and is comfortable to use. This not a \"quiet\" mouse, but for the price it is a great deal. It is too early to evaluate the durability of the mouse, or the battery life, but I have other electronics made by Onn, and they are still going strong after a few years, so I expect a long working life for this mouse.",
