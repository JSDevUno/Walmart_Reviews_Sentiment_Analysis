I am now 61 years old and have no idea what else I'd trust to wash my face. My face feels smooth and not dry after I use it. Ive been using the day wash so long that it was with me through my teenage ache years and young broken heart when crying in the shower! So, to change from my favorite facial cleaner now, nah it is not in my plans!",

      "title": "Why Your Seeing Certain Results",
      "review_text": "SO i have been seeing reviews that say they get a burning sensation from using the clean and clear morning burst face cleanser but that they are also using a brush with it. The reason that you are getting this burning sensation when you use the product is because you are ALSO using the brush. Cleaning you skin with a brush is also a method of exfoliation, which is NOT a bad thing EXCEPT for when you do that everyday. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE EXFOLIATING EVERYDAY. I strongly recommend to only exfoliate once or twice a week because otherwise in the long run you will be taking a toll on your skin and you will be constantly removing skin cells everyday which will cause you skin to look more aged. The beads in this cleanser are already a gentle exfoliant.",

It feels soft on your skin and does what it says it does but i noticed i started to get red spots and blotchy skin. Sometimes it made my face itch and had a rash type of look on my cheeks and chin but that might just be my skin. It is good for its purpose but there are side affects.",
