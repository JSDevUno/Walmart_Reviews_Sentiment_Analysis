We live in an old apartment with no central air and no vent in the bathroom- put this fan in the bathroom and no more poo smells! Loved it so much we bought two more to circulate cold air from outside into our way too well heated appartment. The furnace runs all winter and we are on the bottom floor- these fans helped us cool off our space.",

Using a decimeter I found that in fact, at the lowest speed it was as they said. I also measured the noise levels for second and third speeds at approximately 59-60 and 69-70 respectively. The material is plastic and malleable...not the kind of cheap plastic that breaks or cracks with little effort. The power is adequate for a small bathroom and aided by its moveable fans in different directions. This fan is very convenient and I would recommend it to others.",

It does fit my window, just barely, and I do not extend the sides at all. It's pretty much impossible to make a bladed fan totally silent, but this is quiet enough, and it moves a decent amount of air. The only reason for the 4-star rating is what they called the \"manual\" reversible feature. What that really means is you take the fan out of the window, turn it around, and put it back in the window. In fairness, it is made to do that. The control is accessible from both sides, and the cord also works both ways. But you would not call it convenient. At this price point I guess you can't expect much more. Otherwise I am satisfied with this fan.",
