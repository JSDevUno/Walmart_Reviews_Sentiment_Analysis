It smells like fresh pumpkin with undertones of vanilla. The only real downfall is that it is not an overly strong scent. It is not one of those scents that fill the shower when you use it or lingers around afterwards. There are pros and cons to that, especially if you are someone or are around someone who has allergies to scents a lot. I personally wish it was stronger, but it is still a good scent. As a shampoo it is great. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft overall. It lathered well and rinsed out easily. I will say that the pump is not labeled to tell you which way to turn it to unlock it, not a major issue, but something to keep in mind.

Formulated with hibiscus water and passionfruit extract, this shampoo is designed to cleanse without stripping away the hair's natural moisture. Packaging and Texture: The shampoo comes in a brightly colored, sturdy plastic bottle with a flip-top cap for easy dispensing. The consistency is a bit on the thicker side, but it lathers up nicely and spreads easily through the hair, requiring only a small amount for a full cleanse. Performance: This clarifying shampoo does an excellent job of removing product buildup, residue, and impurities from the scalp and hair. Despite its clarifying abilities, it doesn’t leave hair feeling dry or overly stripped, which can sometimes be a concern with other deep-cleansing shampoos. The formula gently cleanses while maintaining the hair’s moisture balance, leaving it feeling refreshed and light. Scent: The fragrance is a tropical, fruity blend that’s refreshing without being overwhelming. It lingers subtly on the hair, leaving it smelling clean and fresh. Results: After using the Clarifying Shampoo, hair feels thoroughly cleansed but not stripped or brittle. It’s a great choice for those who regularly use styling products, oils, or dry shampoos, as it clears away residue without compromising the health of your hair. While it’s effective in clearing build-up, it also helps to maintain the softness and manageability of the hair, which makes it a great option for regular use—though, depending on your hair type, you may want to alternate with a gentler shampoo to prevent over-drying. Final Thoughts: The Maui Moisture Clarifying Shampoo is a solid choice for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective way to cleanse their hair. It provides a deep clean without the harshness typical of some clarifying shampoos, and its nourishing ingredients ensure your hair stays hydrated and smooth. Perfect for occasional use to remove buildup and refresh your hair, this shampoo delivers great results without sacrificing moisture or softness.",,False,0

People look at Pantene and ask “why are there so many ingredients just to do one simple thing?” The question I want to answer is: “are all the ingredients in Pantene's products needed?” My goal here today is to explain what each ingredient is and for you to decide if there are still too many ingredients. The first hair product I researched is the Pantene Moisture Shampoo. There are 16 ingredients (not including water and fragrance) all doing something important. To make this simple, I will be grouping products depending on what they do. The first group is preservatives. They make sure that the hair product doesn't grow mold and bacteria.There are 5 different preservatives: Trisodium citrate Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Tetrasodium EDTA Sodium benzoate Methylisothiazolinone. These 5 ingredients work together to help preserve your shampoo so it is safe to use. If there weren't any preservatives, you could get bacterial breakouts on your scalp and could develop fungal diseases. The second group is different types of conditioners. These are products that help heal and condition hair. There aren't as many conditioning agents in shampoo as there are in conditioner but having them can still drastically impact your hair's health. In this category there are 7 different ingredients: Panthenol Citricum Salicylate Cocamidopropyl Betaine Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride Histidine, Cocamide MEA. These ingredients help counteract the damaging effects of striping your hair of all its oils. Sulfates are amazing cleaning agents because they get rid of everything, putting back moisture and oil will leave your hair not only feeling clean, but also healthy. The last category is cleaning agents. These products are there to help remove dirt and oil. Your scalp constantly creates sebum or oil and if you don't remove it, it will start clogging your hair follicles. This can lead your hair to stop growing . It can also affect how healthy the ends of your hair are because new hair isn't growing. There are 4 ingredients in this group, but 2 of them are there to improve the texture of your hair. These ingredients are Sodium chloride Sodium laureth sulfate Glycol distearate Lauramidopropyl betaine. It is a common misconception that sulfates are bad but if you have ever used shampoo with sulfates you have probably noticed that your hair feels a lot cleaner. You might have even noticed that it looks and feels more healthy. This is because your hair is getting cleaned better. The oil your hair produces is important, but an excess of oils will damage your hair. If you have had better results by using a product that doesn't have any sulfates, then by all means keep on using it. Not all products work the same on everyone, but, if you don't feel like you have been getting a good wash or your hair gets oily really quick, you might think about switching to a shampoo with sulfates. Overall, knowing what is in your hair products and what each ingredient does is super important. I hope you came away from this review knowing that there is a reason for each ingredient that goes into a hair product and not to judge something before you buy it.

It is much more natural looking. I have extremely oily skin and this hasn't helped Mattify anymore than any other powder but is definitely less candy and feels nice on your skin.

I would prefer to not wear foundation but ELF discontinued the mineral line much to my dismay. I am preferring the more natural look of using concealer and this powder and I think I look younger without the heavy makeup. This has no coverage and no color, it just disappears on my face but it gives a more matte finish and makes my face appear smoother. I love being able to put it on throughout the day without ever having to worry about looking chalky or having makeup in my lines. This powder is very soft so beware of dropping it, mine arrived broken but I use it anyway. I apply it with the Ultimate Blending Brush (LOVE!) and it works great.

Don't even get me started on the Pure Skin line!! SO good. Anyway, I do want to educate people on this product, because I've noticed a lot of the Reviewers don't sewm to understand what's going on here. In Asian skincare, they make exfoliating products called ""Peeling Gels."" That is definitely where Elf got the inspiration for this product. I love peeling gels SO much. They provide gentle physical exfoliation, and many have fruit acids, PHAs, LHAs, etc to provide a light chemical exfoliation as well. What makes the Elf one stand out is the lotion like consistency when you first apply it, and I love the scent. My complexion is always super smooth and even toned after using this product. For the people who think they are seeing ""so much dead skin coming off""...that is NOT your skin loves. 😂 That is the cellulose in the product that is intentionally formulated to ball up on itself. That is how the product works lol. The little bits of balled up cellulose are what provide the mechanical exfoliation. Now, obviously some dead skin will be removed..as that's the entire point of an exfoliating product, but 98% of what you are seeing is the product itself. The act of rubbing it in is what causes the product to ball up and exfoliate. I just felt the need to clear that up because it seems that there are a lot of customers who do not understand how this product works and, if you ever have THAT much dead skin balling up and falling off of your face, that would actually be a little concerning lol.

BEWARE--- it says gentle, but I was stupid enough to use it 3 times a row to make sure all the dead skin was off....I ended up taking a layer off my nose 😂 the directions on the bottle clearly say to use it 2 or 3 times a WEEK...so I shouldn't have used it 3 times in a row back to back. That was stupid of me. But hey.... more proof it works VERY well. Lol.",,False,0

I am 69 years old and had extremely dry facial skin. I read a review on this Walmart product in which the reviewer said her skin was dry until after using this exfoliant and decided to try it- such a good price I couldn't resist! You use a few drops onto either wet or dry skin and ""voila""! Dry skin sloughs off in tiny balls! I did this 3 times on my face making sure to get close to the hairline and even unto my neck. You rub as directed in small circles then rinse with warm water, dry the skin and repeat I would say no more than 2 times-less if you have sensitive skin. But my skin was so dry that it took 3 repeating rounds to get off all the dry skin. I was left with NEWBORN BABY SOFT SKIN!!! It felt so soft. I applied my usual moisturiser and my skin was still soft 3 days later! The directions say to use 1-2 times per week and I will follow that regime. The results are amazing-no more over-priced exfoliants with tiny beads in them-they do nothing compared to e.l.f. Gentle Peeling Exfoliant! Men and younger people with dry skin would benefit from this product too. I will use it on my hands, neck and upper chest that are my dry skin areas. I am ordering another bottle (even thought I think a whole bottle will last 4-8 weeks at least) just in case e.l.f. decides to raise the price based on these great reviews! Thank you e.l.f. for this great product and all your other products. And thank you Walmart for keeping prices low for hard working Americans.",,False,0
