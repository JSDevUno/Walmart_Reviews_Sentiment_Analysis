      "review_text": "After tiring of losing control of internet connected devices during brief power outages, I purchased this UPS and added my internet run hubs as well as our home theater power. No loss of connection during power brief outages. With a 55\" TV and home theater devices, I can get a somewhat short time before losing battery power and so I usually power down the home theater after 15 minutes and that provides many hours of backup for the other devices on it. We don't have power problems that often or I could buy a beefier ups.",

The battery back up gives me a few minutes to power off my computer and save my work before I turn off power to the battery back up. During Hurricane Milton, we lost power for 8 days so this did not have a chance to maintain a full charge but once power was restored, plugged it in and it charged right up! Helps me to continue working if power winks out for a second or two! Even helps the WiFi to remain on!",
