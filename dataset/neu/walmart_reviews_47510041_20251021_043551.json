Shae butter is a very common and healthy moisturizing ingredient so it shouldn't cause concern for those of you who don't know what it is. However, it is concerning for me due to my allergy.

My mom encouraged me to really moisturize shortly after I married at 21, I am so glad she did, I am 65 today and still get compliments. I remember the large heavy milk glass like jars my mom would have on her dresser and that familiar delicate Pond's fragrance. (I would see her use it on her body as well as her face and neck too) My face, neck, and decolletage are the main concentration areas and they are looking better than ever.

I was amazed at the difference it made in my skin and I have continued to use it. The results have been wonderful and I will never look back.

I rushed back to store and finally after applying it, I feel my skin got its life back. Thanks Pond's. I wish Pond's do release their facial powder here in US. We get them only in India.

My only complaint is the scent reminds me of flowers at a wake (sorry, that was my first impression). The scent lessens after a few minutes, so I can deal with it.

However, none of them worked..multiple products would \"pill up\" on my face and 20 minutes after applying you couldn't even tell i had used them. But then...I found Ponds. My great aunt, who always had such a beautiful face told me to try Ponds. She swore by it, as it is the only product she's used in over 50 years! I was determined to immediately go pick up a jar and try it for myself. Voila! Immediately I felt a difference, my skin felt refreshed, felt like elasticity was back and it has a nice Glow! I didn't realize how beautiful I look...Thanks Ponds for giving me my youthful pretty face back!",
