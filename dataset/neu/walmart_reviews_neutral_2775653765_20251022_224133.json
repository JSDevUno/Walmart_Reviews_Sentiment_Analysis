The shoes did fit okay. The 'Crocs' turned out to be much too large. One was not in the pattern as pictured. So, I ordered another pair of each style of 'Crocs' in size 7. One was sent in the correct size which I am keeping. This style, which I am reviewing was sent in a size 11... way too large... but in the same pattern as originally pictured!!! Now I have to go through the process of returning things... ugh!!!",

I don't think they would be good for yard work or marine environments. The pink is a true light pink, not a coral pink as it appears on the screen. This actually was a nice surprise as I prefer true pink. They are very light.",
