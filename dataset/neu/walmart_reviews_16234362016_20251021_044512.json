I use it in the evenings for overnight moisturizing of my face, neck, and chest. I also like it during the day for quick moisture on my hands when they feel dry. It definitely hydrates my skin giving it a plumper, firmer, less crepey look. It is a heavier cream that I use in the evenings. It is gentle and has caused no irritation or breakouts. This is a high-quality product with the effectiveness you expect from Cetaphil. I like that it is packaged in this tube that is easy to open and easy to dispense just the amount of product I want.

Does well with a toner on top but I let it absorb first. I love that it's fragrance-free, paraben-free, and hypoallergenic — perfect for me during pregnancy! Great and deep hydration, which is so crucial in our dry state on New Mexico! It actually feels like it helps with firmness and gives my skin a more rested, healthier look. I've been using it daily and already see a difference — especially on days when my skin feels tired or dry. It absorbs well and layers nicely under sunscreen or makeup too.

I have only used this a short time and cannot say much about the firming aspect, but there are several other things I noticed and liked. It is a thick formula so it is not messy and it absorbed well into my skin. Since the formula is thicker, you only need a small amount to get the job done. I also personally liked that it had almost no scent to it as well. I have fragrances I like to put on myself and do not like having my lotion compete with them.
