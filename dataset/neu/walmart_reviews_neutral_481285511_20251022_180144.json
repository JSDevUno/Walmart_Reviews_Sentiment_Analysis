      "review_text": "My grandmother is 96 years old and has to breathe concentrated oxygen constantly. The power in her apartment frequently goes out whenever it storms there, so on several occasions over the years she's found herself suddenly suffocating in the dark and forced to try to open a portable oxygen cylinder with arthritic hands. She has never owned a computer and has no need for one, but her oxygen concentrator draws a significant amount of power. The 900 V/A UPS that I use for my computer only lasted 6 minutes under that load, so after some research I settled on this product. This battery backup still only lasts for 15-20 minutes, so it will not provide continuous power through most blackouts, but it gives her enough time for either neighbors, family, or emergency services to check on her and open an oxygen tank or plug the oxygen machine into a generator with an extension cord. The battery alarm will also immediately let her know she needs help if the power goes out in the middle of the night rather than violently coughing herself awake, which is how she used to find out. This device was put to the test less than a month after I put it in her home. She initially panicked when the lights went out, but realized after 30 seconds that she could still breathe. The UPS worked exactly the way I hoped it would. She was able to remain calm and safe until help arrived. I recommend anyone with elderly relatives to consider something like this as an option, but you will need to do some math first and make sure the volts / amps / watts on whatever you're plugging into it will last long enough on battery power to suit your purposes.",
