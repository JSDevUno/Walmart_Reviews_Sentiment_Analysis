TKL keyboards because eliminating the ten-key numpad provides more space for large mouse swipes and allows for better ergonomics while gaming. I love the sleek design and High-Quality Polymer Frame made very well. The lighting effects is cool practical playing games in the dark. There 3 built-in channels where the cable can exit the keyboard, keeping your desk tidy. The gaming-Grade Anti-Ghosting fast keystroke. Compatibility with Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox, and PS4.
