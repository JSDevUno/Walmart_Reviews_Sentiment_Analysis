The shut off and lockups started to happen more often, but it would always recover. As of today, 04-11-2025, it will not boot up far enough to load windows 11. It goes through a bunch of lengthy self-repair modes and then displays a bunch of failures.",

      "review_text": "I liked the mini computer. Booted nice, ran well, handled all of my software. After running for around 24 hours it shut down. The light was on and the machine sounded like it was running but it lost all info to my monitor. I had to unplug and do a hard re-boot. It did it again within 15 minutes. Left it off over night and ran it again the next day. It did it again after 12 hours or so. I'm guessing that possibly it is a video problem and is shutting down for some problem. Possibly overheating? Doesn't feel hot though. I am returning it and ordering another one from the same company in hopes it is just a glitch. This will be your second chance GMKtec.",
