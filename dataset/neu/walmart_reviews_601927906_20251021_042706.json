Helps removing make up and feeling fresh. It does not dry my skin out or make it oily which was my problem with a lot of cleansers. I have fairly balanced skin and this works great at keeping it there. Been using for about 3 years now? And will continue. Price is friendly and product is worth it",

I use this twice a day and have had no issues with breakouts or sensitivity. I only have two (small) gripes about the product. The packaging could use a revamp. A flip-top bottle is not ideal. I found a pump dispenser that fits the neck of the bottle perfectly and solved that problem. The other issue is the scent. It's not offensive, but it is a bet chemical-ish. It's not strong and doesn't linger at all so this is a very minor point, but if it had no discernable fragrance it would be perfection. Still, it's one of the best cleansers I've ever found for my skin. Two thumbs up!",

Well I'm definitely going to be stocking up when I get back because wow! It takes off makeup very well, including my waterproof mascara and eyeliner, and it leaves the skin so so soft. My skin is noticeably hydrated and supple, and it softens without leaving a sticky or residue feeling. I have fair oily skin for reference, it also pairs well with the primers i've used and doesn't cause my makeup to break up. 10/10, gonna have to try the other products in this line now.",

I follow it up with the Keep Your Balance Toner and the Holy Hydration Fragrance Free Cream. This has changed my skin for the better. I have combination skin, usually pretty dry but in my T zone it's oily. This is such a lightly purifying cleanser that is not harsh on the skin. This line is my favourite and forever go too. Highly recommend. The only thing I would change is the packaging. I wish they had a bigger size or at least a pump for it.",

Daily Cleanser and liked that it contained hyaluronic acids that help hydrate the skin and ceramides that keep moisture locked in. I used a dime size amount on makeup free skin and I felt refreshed but not tight or greasy. The gel has wonderful slip and I spent time working in the product and giving myself a mini facial massage. I didn't notice any strong fragrance and my skin was left clean, hydrated and glowing. I have replaced my regular go-to cleanser with this one and I actually prefer this packaging with the snap lid. It's usually so hard to get the last amount of product that has a pump dispenser. With the snap lid, I just turn the bottle upside down to get all the product out.",

So needless to say after the first couple washes I quickly bought the bigger bottle and have been using this faithfully for a year and the holy hydration skin care line is my favorite.. E.L.F. PLEASE MAKE THIS IN A BIGGER BOTTLE PLEASE!!! It's not overly priced and is absolutely wonderful, my pre teen daughter uses it as she has very oily skin and very VERY sensitive skin and this doesn't break her out at all or irritate her skin in any way!! I definitely 10000% would recommend this product!! And the whole holy hydration line!!",

BRo, it removes my makeup. My FULL EYESHADOW makeup looks like a meling balm but in a gel consistency. AND, it does not burn my eyes. I have dry skin and admit that it is not the most hydrating. But, it's not totally stripping. If you've used the La Roche Posay, it's less drying than that. But for the value, and amount of product, this might just replace my melting makeup balm. It's really THAT good. I use this and then go in with a gentle cleanser for a double cleanse. I can't believe there's a product of this conssitenly that removes makeup so well. I apply it on dry skin and gradually add water.",

I am a beauty writer and esthetician of over 25 years and believe that it is the INGREDIENTS that matter over fancy packaging and slick ads. I am a huge fan! However, this is one of just two products from the brand I don't love and won't repurchase. I have normal to dry skin and have been using LRP cleaner — I had high hopes, but this formula just zapped all the moisture from my skin, leaving it super dry. My 19 year old is now using it on his oily skin and is enjoying it. This one is just not for me. I still love everything else from e.l.f. & no one can believe that I am not using medical grade skincare because my skin is so fresh and dewy looking. Give this cleanser a try - it is well formulated - just not right for my skin.",
