I placed my order and waited. Come to find out the product is not coming from a Walmart warehouse but in fact is coming from China directly. My package was delayed/delivered over a week later than originally stated. I waited until the week of Christmas to open the package and check out my purchase and man was I surprised. A few weeks back I had ordered what I thought were a similar pair of slipper for myself on T-E-M-U. They arrived and I opened them the same time I opened the Walmart set. I was beyond annoyed when my six dollar pair of slippers were the EXACT same size same as the set from Walmart that were three times as much. All of that being said, I will review the actual slippers themselves not the shady practices of the third party seller. The slippers are decently cute in person, not as nice looking as they were online. The bottom sole is very strange almost plastic. Would I knowingly purchase this same pair again? Probably not. I think I have had beater luck buying in store at Walmart or Sam’s Club and will go that route from now on.",
