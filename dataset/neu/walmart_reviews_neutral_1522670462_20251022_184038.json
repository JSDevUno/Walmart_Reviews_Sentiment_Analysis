It has great features, like the forward and back buttons on the side, plus, the USB conveniently stores in the battery compartment. However, I only used it for 5 minutes before my laptop crashed. I figured it had to be a fluke, so I tried it on my son's laptop. Shortly after inserting the USB, his screen froze, so I immediately removed it, did a restart and data recovery. Thankfully, his laptop is working fine. Mine won't turn on. I never leave negative reviews, as I like to give products the benefit of the doubt, but I can't in good faith recommend this. It's too random to be coincidence.",
