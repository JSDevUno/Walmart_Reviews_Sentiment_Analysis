      "review_text": "It's compactvan ergonomic design allowed me to find a sweet spot for it in my crowded room. Since power outages are an everyday thing in PR I was able to test it the same day that I installed it. I connected my PC two monitors my modem and router. The Nvidia Android box and a 65\" LG TV. Although I have Tesla batteries, there's like a 30 sec. lag between the transfer. This loss of power has made my PC shut down and causes havoc on the electronics. Last week, we had the power go on and off 8 times in about 30 minutes. Back to the UPS, it did its job. Everything remained on until the Teslas kicked in.",

      "review_text": "Dont trust your item is new. Recieved an item that was most likely returned. Had no paperwork, it wouldnt turn on after initial charge, just kept making a clicking sound. Had to return and buy the only other one walmart had in stock. Second one was actually new and works well. We have 2 gaming computers plugged in both with 750W-800W PSU in them. While gaming, the Battery backup estimates that we would have about 8-10 min of battery life should the power go out, this should give plenty of time to shut our machines down safely. While idle with both pcs on it says about 40 min of time. Only complaint about the product itself is that i wish it had one more spaced out socket on the battery backup side since both my router and modem have bulky plugs.",
