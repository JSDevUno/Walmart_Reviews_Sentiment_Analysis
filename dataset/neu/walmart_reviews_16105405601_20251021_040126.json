      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This shampoo scent is vanilla cream and pumpkin, and I think it smells pretty true to that. It smells like fresh pumpkin with undertones of vanilla. The only real downfall is that it is not an overly strong scent. It is not one of those scents that fill the shower when you use it or lingers around afterwards. There are pros and cons to that, especially if you are someone or are around someone who has allergies to scents a lot. I personally wish it was stronger, but it is still a good scent. As a shampoo it is great. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft overall. It lathered well and rinsed out easily. I will say that the pump is not labeled to tell you which way to turn it to unlock it, not a major issue, but something to keep in mind. If you have used native hair products in the past this one is no different. So if the scent sounds good to you I would recommend trying it out, especially with the upcoming fall season.",

      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently received Native's Vanilla Cream & Pumpkin Moisturizing Shampoo for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review and I absolutely loved this product. This shampoo has a smooth texture that lathers over the hair effortlessly. One pump of this shampoo can lather over a large portion of your hair. This shampoo does a great job at removing the daily buildup of oils and dirt in your hair while also not striping it of all hydration completely. It actually is very effective at cleaning the hair without being striping and instead providing moisture. The scent is a major pro of this shampoo as it has a lovely fall scent of vanilla cream and pumpkin that is so beautiful. The packaging is also great as this shampoo container has a fair amount of shampoo and the pump dispenser releases the perfect amount with each pump. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a beautifully scented moisturizing shampoo that comes at an affordable price.",
