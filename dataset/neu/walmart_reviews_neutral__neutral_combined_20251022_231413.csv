For the $3 price, I was concerned the colors may be neon, even though not described that way. The blue is a bit neon for public wear, the collar is big and it looked frumpy on me, so I didn't like it, but my mom liked it as a PJ top, so we ordered other colors at the price. We've been pleasantly surprised by the green, purple and especially the WHITE!!! The fabric feels very close to a regular tshirt, but it doesn't wrinkle and it doesn't look like polyester or spandex (on the white one, in particular). The red and blue are much cheaper looking because of the “neon” look of the colors in person. The red is more of a Christmas red - a slight orange tint. I highly recommend the white (5 stars). Others are ok: Green %26 purple (3.5 stars). Blue %26 red (3 stars if you just wear them around home. 1.5 stars if you expect to add them to your wardrobe.) We got the black, but I don't think I've seen it on her yet and I can't find it for the pic or review.",,False,0

I usually buy 2 - 1L bottles at a time, so when I received these new ones I was disappointed that they changed completely - formula, smell, and bottle. As disappointing as this was I decided to give it a chance, perhaps the product was actually improved. After two weeks of almost daily use here's how it performed: - The smell is ok if you're into lime, but I'm not a fan. Part of the appeal of the original was how beautiful yet subtle the scent was. - It doesn't lather, I had to use 2X the amount of shampoo to get any decent lather - even then I had to shampoo twice. - My hair has become dull, dry and flat. - It's become incredibly static, it's unreal how much - if I run my hand down the side my hair just lifts up as if I'd rubbed a balloon on it. Just today I was having a conversation outside of my gym and as I was talking I moved my hair off my shoulder and it generated so much static my hair lifted up and then stuck all across my face. It was a little embarrassing, but I laughed it off. My overall experience is that this is one of the worst shampoos I've ever used. It seems as if Wella has essentially created a new product, discontinued an old one, and just piggybacked on the original products' positive reviews and high ratings. They really should have officially discontinued Wells Brilliance and created a new product entirely. It's a shame at what Wella has done with this product. This is a complete fiasco.",,False,0
