Unfortunately, when I attempted to plug in a small oscillating fan in perfectly good wording condition, the cord exploded in sparks. Fortunately, I was not injured and my fan still works. I returned the damaged cord. This was unnerving and dangerous. Obviously, quality control is lacking. Thank you Walmart for the easy return.",
