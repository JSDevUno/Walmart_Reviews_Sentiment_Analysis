      "review_text": "I have always wanted a screen door that was easy to open for my two year old to walk in and out. She plays with the sprinkler throughout the summer, and having the door closed is a headache because she cant walk in whenever she wants. Leaving it open is a headache as well, since all the flies and mosquitoes come in as they please. Installation was easy and quick, maybe 15 minutes. I noticed that the Velcro tape didn't stick very well to the paint I had at the door, so I added some staples. There is a lot of magnets down the middle, so it stays shut not allowing any insects in. I can now leave the door open to let fresh air enter without the bugs!",
