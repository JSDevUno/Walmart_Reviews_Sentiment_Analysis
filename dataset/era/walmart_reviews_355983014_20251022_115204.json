They also have both draw strings AND belt loops which isnt a very common feature of joggers. They do run a little on the small side, so I had to buy a 4X rather than an 2X for myself and I wear a 40-42 inch waist x 34 inch inseam.",

I haven't called to talk to Walmart yet. But I am going to. Other than the size, the joggers pants are nice and comfortable and nice material. The question they ask if I recommend those joggers pants. I do recommend for the material but not on the size. They should have MAYBE option. I am going to say NO for the bigger guys.

These jogger pants are ugly and waaay over sized,,, they sag way to low in the crotch and behind. My Teenage son was looking forward to these ,, but let down, bad. He is 12yrs,, 5'11 185-190 pds,, Soo, I went up a size as said to 2xL(well ordered that, but received 3xL, eye roll) he normally wear about a XL or 1X in mens pants like that. But that wasn't just the issue. They were just terrible. They fit in the waist, but the crotch and back(as I said earlier) hung down to his knees,,,, and Not in anyone nice looking. The price was high as well. Now to try and figure out how to send them back, or refund. Will not buy another in this brand, ever. Very disappointed, because they look nice in the pictures. Hope this helps someone, somewhat :)))",
