      "review_text": "Just bought 5 pairs of “Galaxy by Harvic” Men's Flex Stretch Slim Fit Cotton Everyday Chino Pants (31\" Inseam) size 38. The stitching all throughout each pair is atrocious. I'm honestly surprised they made it through the wash %26 dry. Material isn't all that soft. Kind of feels like really thin jeans. Also the brand is listed as Harvic but the tags all say Bastion Trail with the tagline “Premium Clothing Since 1984” but there's nothing premium about these pants. At $13 a piece I suppose I got what I paid for lol",
