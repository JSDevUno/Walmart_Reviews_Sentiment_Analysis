It's the only pants he wears. The funny, ironic, Freudian fact about these pants are I've been buying myself flex jeans for about twenty years and never thought about that type of pant for him.

The pant legs are so wide my husband could probably fit both legs in one pant leg alone. I couldn't remember which ones these were, we had bought a pair recently and my husband was swimming in them, they cause you to massively sweat in high temps and cause rashes, so I ordered an extra pair of regular fit just in case. Of course the random color I chose for regular fit was unavailable and now my husband is left with these monstrosities for his construction interview today (yes, jeans are appropriate). Super frustrating. Please take these off the local shelf or add the ones that don't have \"big men\" in the title because not everyone needs that much room and they can't fit skinny jeans, which seems to be the other options.",

The waist sizing of the non-flex versions are not even close to being correct. The 28 is a little bigger than the 29, but still a bit small. The waist of the flex version is bigger than the others and actually a bit too big, but multiple washings may take care of that. Also, the 30 length was at least 1 1/2 inches longer than specified on the non-flex version; the flex version looks pretty close to being correct. The flex fabric feels somewhat thinner than the non-flex jeans, but they are quite comfortable. We'll see how well they hold up over time. All in all, I recommend the flex relaxed fit Wrangler jeans. It's just too bad that Wrangler has such terrible quality control regarding sizing.",

      "review_text": "1) I hate this new trend where all pants seem to have this elastic underwear like waste ban flex-fit made into every inch of denim if any inch of a pair of jeans is even what used to be strong and durable denim. 2)This elastic trash falls apart in mear months of regular everyday use, whereas an actual single denim pair of jeans would last me 3 to 4 years on the low end, this flex fit trash hardly lasts 6 months! 3) This stuff shrinks up to nothing in the wash, then after a few days of wearing it starts falling off you again. Then if washed many times the elastic stop doing what it does and the \"denim fabric\" seems to get and keep the durability of wet paper. 4) Ordered what I thought was normal denim somehow got this flex fit trash but even though the tag says 44X32 (my waste is 43in) the so-called denim jeans have give of 7in in the waste?! Why?! 5) Just stop all jeans makers, stop putting this flex fit elastic trash in men's jeans! I want an actual denim pair of jeans with real denim that lasts more than 6 months. I miss the days I could buy even a cheap off-brand of denim jeans without this trash elastic flex fit made into it.",

However the dark denim (shown in my pic) and slate versions have significant polyester content (12 and 7 percent respectively) so they won't be as breathable on humid days. Same is true of at least one of the denim shorts (flex dark, not bought here). The cargo shorts I've tried are 98 percent cotton, 2 percent spandex, no polyester, which is fine. Be sure to inspect the labels sewn into the interiors of the jeans and shorts before you remove the tags and be prepared to return them if you want a true cotton/spandex blend. Five stars for the correctly labeled products, but overall rating has to be lower due to the mislabeling.",

      "review_text": "These are the best fitting and most comfortable jeans that I have ever had. That 1% spandex is a miracle that allows the material to stretch. You should have the 1% spandex in all clothes! I would like to see it in t-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts; underwear, and all types of pants. I bought the shorts that I use for golf that have the 1% spandex and they are my favorite golf shorts. My older man belly could use some situps and normal pants are too tight for comfort. Larger size is too bulky. The 1% spandex allows the pants to stretch to button. The fit is snug, not pulling tight as would be with normal pants. The fit is comfortable. I am cleaning out my closet of older jeans, replacing with 1 % spandex as well as all golf shorts. Make polos with 1 % spandex and I will replace mine with those. Put the 1% spandex in cotton jackets, etc. It really, really works. Give a raise to the employee that came up with the 1 % spandex; genius!!!! Thanks for making clothes comfortable!

I exchanged and paid for 40/30 because i was told that an inch longer in the inseam would make the waist wider. I received the 40/30 and there was no change, but tagged as a 40/30. I have 3 other pairs of wrangler jeans all in size 40/30 and no problems in the waist and actually a little loose which is nice. One of those pairs is exactly this model jean. I don't want to upsize since then I am sure it will be too loose and unable to wear them. I have 60 days to return this item...maybe closer to 45 days, but its not worth paying to ship it back because I wouldn't break even on the return since i would be paying shipping twice. After contacting customer service and being told to buy an upsize inseam a manager should have taken the call and provided me with a free pair.",

As all were ordered the same size and at the same time, I checked the sizing label to make sure all were as ordered. The Difference I found was the Indigo and Medium Stone called out 99% Cotton, 1% Spandex which is what the website description says whereas the Coal Black pair calls out 99% Cotton, 1% Elastane. Looking up \"Elastane\", it says it's another name for Spandex or Lycra. Something seems off as they don't fit. I really wanted a pair of Black Jeans comparable to fit of the blue ones but am now questioning if I was delivered the wrong pair of Coal Black Jeans or if I re-order, will they come as Cotton and Spandex or if I upsize, will I swim in them.

Had it not been in the grouped with the type \"a\", I wouldn't have bought them. Unfortunately, you can't tell from Walmart's web site, because they all show 99% cotton. It isn't until you go to Wrangler's web site and you can see the material for each one. But because Wrangler groups them together, that's probably why Walmart groups them together. And Wrangler's naming and model convention is hard to decipher, so good luck. I found that the number starting with \"1097\" will work on a search if you drop the beginning \"10\".",

I don't know if it is the Wrangler companies fault or the fact that Walmart tells companies what they will be charging for the jeans and the companies have to skimp on materials to hit the price point. From everything I have read about how much control Walmart has with suppliers, I suspect it is the latter. First, the denim is extremely lightweight, not what you expect if you have ever purchased wranglers before. Second, they cut the denim too short on the back pane of the front pockets, so the stitching and white pocket fabric pucker out no matter what - even when you're standing straight up. This was the case on both pockets for all four pair that I bought. I probably should have learned from the last time I bought Rustler jeans from Walmart. They, too, were very lightweight, they didn't have the tiny front pocket, and the insufficient number of belt loops tore out very easy as did the back pockets.",

      "review_text": "It's not always easy buying clothes online because for some reason, X size with one company is not the same at another company. I needed some blue jeans that didn't cost $50 - $60 dollars or more, provided a little \"give\" if and when needed, and looked nice. These checked all the boxes and were a great value for the money. Would definitely recommend these to those who need a larger size.",
