Black does hide grease a bit better than the tan ones, however I do find that my fluffy white cat is attracted more to these pants than my other ones. Cargo pockets have pleats, so they will fit more than just something flat. 2 \"extra\" belt loops help quite a bit with extra equipment on the belt (pager, radio, keys, multi-tool, etc). Pants look best if taken out of the dryer warm and not too dry (use the energy efficiency setting) and then hung, or pressed; they are a bit prone to getting wrinkled if allowed to cool and dry in a pile. After a wash or two, leg pockets will not be flat unless they are pressed.",

These pants are well-made of a heavier material than most Wrangler Cargo pants I have. A little warm for summer, but nice even then when the restaurant or bar you are in have their thermostat set on \"August\", or whatever it is that makes those places too cold to enjoy in the same clothes in which you came from the outdoors. Unlike other cargo pants I have, these have only the one slit pocket for a smart phone (it's on the left side), rather than one on each side, just in case that matters to you. A plus is that these pants come in odd-numbered waist sizes. I wanted a 31\"-inch waist (not a 30 or a 32), and that's what I got. And they fit perfectly.",

These Wrangler cargo pants (not jeans) are also supposedly 34's, but they are considerably smaller in the waist. They fit me very tight. It's difficult to tell much else about them, because I can't wear them. Since I'm in the process of losing weight, I'll hold onto them for a couple of weeks to see if I can get down to their size. They are also very stiff, at least they way they come from the factory. I suspect it's a lot of \"sizing\" that will wash out, but I can't be sure, because they fit so badly that I don't want to wash them and then not be able to return them.

The fabric seems ok, but having been buying these exact same pants for 10 years, I have to say the overall quality has gone down. When I first started buying them, 3 pairs reliably lasted my husband a full year. It was like clockwork. Every year, I'd pick him up 3 pairs at tax time, and by the time it rolled around again, they were getting holes or losing buttons, and I'd replace them. In the last few years, things like losing buttons and ripping/unravelling seams have meant that instead of once a year, I'm buying them like three times a year. They're still the only pants my husband will wear, though, so I'm still buying them, and the price isn't bad, especially if you catch them on sale. I just miss the days when I only had to think about my husband's pants once a year!",

I was happy to be able to replace them without shelling out a lot of money. This time, I bought a pair in black and one in khaki. I'm happy with both. I am also glad that Walmart offers these pants in 30 W by 30 L. Short folks need pants too. I'd like to see the pants offered in 30 W by 29 L.",

The material is thin enough to be soft but thick enough to be durable. Very comparable with the Dickies cotton work pants but I think softer and more comfortable. These pants do fade some over time but not as bad as Dockers I have had. Back pockets are big enough for me to put my iPad mini in. Side cargo pockets are too but can't close the Velcro top. Careful if you get horizontal (lay down) with them as everything seems to empty out of the front pockets when you do. Transfer to the cargo pockets if your work gets you at that angle. Side note - If you use the site to store for a local store be aware that going to the back to wait for your order takes more time than just going to the store to buy it.

I was a jeans guy for years but these are by far more comfortable and practical. The fit is outstanding. They stay at your waist so you're not pulling them up all day. They run true to size and the rise is perfect. They are lightweight, cool and wear like iron. I've gotten them soaking wet a number of times and they've dried out completely within 15 to 20 minutes. I work in a rough environment and these pants have held up. Pockets are roomy and well placed for easy access but not bulky so they don't stick out and snag on rough edges. The cell phone pocket holds my iPhone 6 in LifeProof case securely but makes it easy to grab. That's about the max for the cell phone pocket but a larger size phone would easily fit in one of the cargo pockets.",

The only complaint is it seems wrangler doesn't seem to understand there are thin tall people out there, who need a longer leg length in relation to a small waist size, especially with a teenager. He really needs a 30x33 or 30x34, and they only make them up to a 30x32. After they are washed and dried, the leg length does shrink! I try to get them out of the dryer, before they are completely dried. Then I pull and stretch the legs out. This helps a little, but not much! Other than the size issue, these are wonderful pants at a great value! Thanks to Wrangler and Walmart!",

The corners of the pocket covers are the only thing that would need to be ironed if you are going to get picky. I bought the black pants and they are suitable for casual dress. The fit on the pair I got is prefect at the waist and lenght. The pockets are deep and roomy, and that was important to me. The velcro flaps on the side pockets allow easy access, and keep important things like your wallet secure. They have a leg that is a bit wider than I like, however all things considered they are the best cargo pants I own. I plan to order them in the other color tonight. I hope that helps you decide.",

The device pocket combo stitched behind the cargo pocket on the left hand side in genius! It fits my Samsung Galaxy S7 in an Otterbox case great and it i have not had a problem with it. Really a great design, only cargo jeans i can find so far that does this. Quality is great, i used one pair rigorously the summer of 2016 and by the end of the year no tears but small, not even pea sized holes started to emerge. From what they've been through it was defiantly worth the $20 for a single pant. I bought 3 more pairs for my company uniform this year. Doesn't seem to stain bad with grass/dirt, etc. Very happy purchase and will continue to buy them. Thanks Wrangler!",

After being worn 4 times the front pocket ripped, okay fixed what could have been a machine glitch. Now 11 wears in the button has ripped out. Get with the program people! Men wearing these for work are moving about and putting stuff in the pockets. Wrangler the new fabric is a big fail!",

      "review_text": "After wearing Wrangler cargo pants for over 4 years now this new pair came with an unexpected change: the cell phone pocket was moved from the right leg to the left. I guess that might be great for left-handed folks. But it is an unpleasant change for me. Also, because the phone pocket was made shorter, the phone has a tendency to slide up when you get in or out of the truck - one day I am sure, it will fall out onto the ground. Otherwise, these pants are great, a little lighter weight which should be great for the summer.",
