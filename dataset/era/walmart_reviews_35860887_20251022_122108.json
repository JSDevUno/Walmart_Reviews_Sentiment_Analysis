      "review_text": "These pants are my favorite. Very nice slim fit, and just as tough as the original 874s. They aren't slim like a skinny pant, but they are a tad bit slimmer than the classic 874, giving a nice slim look to the legs and seat. I would recommend sizing up though, the pant has a very small/short rise, and it could feel tight I. The groin if you are bigger or heavier. If very slim or skinny, you're good with regular size. I'm heavy, so I ordered a 36, instead of my usual 34, and they fit just right. Awesome pants. I do wish and hope that Dickies could add more colors to the 873 Slim line.",

Shorter rise than 874's should work better for me since I wear pants on the hip (there's nothing else for them to hang onto). Had to alter the pants by taking up about 1.5\" at the back of the waistband (after washing and drying with high heat), feathering the take-out half-way down the seat. So tailored, they now fit well. The \"size up\" guidance for 874's does not apply to this pair of pants.",

I needed something more formal than jeans but just as durable. I used to wear the Original 874 at a truck wash and knew these were durable pants but wanted the slims for a better fit. They are very comfortable and fit well, except that they are low rise so tucking a shirt in the pants makes you think they should be higher making them tight in the crotch. This is only noticable putting them on in the beginning of the day and disappears once you start moving. Also after the first wash the dye on the edge of the pleat faded a lot making the pleat stand out more than usual. Bought the first pair in navy and am waiting on the second pair in chocolate brown. Works for everything I want it for just wish it was a mid rise pant to give more room.",

While this may not be a sign of poor craftmanship, or materials used: I am aware of it. The front waist of the pants sits higher than I personally expected. It does ride up over my belt, which causes odd bunching, and correcting every so often. It's not terrible by any means. It may seem like I do not like these pants, but I really do love them, and the company Dickies overall. I may try a different cut next time, but these may become my \"go-to\" pair for a long while.

Sush is not the case and you should survey rotund men to find out what they would really like. How about a slim fit, straight leg, short rise to fit a 50 inch girth.",

They shrink over a period of time and they will eventually become a size 34 by the time it's worn and wash enough. It would be nice to have a shorter seam length like down to a 26 or 28 for the shorter leg folks. Otherwise, good pants for automotive attire.",

When I got them I realized I should have ordered TWO SIZES smaller than all of my other pants. I still can't believe how big the waist was considering the website mentioned nothing about this fit running large. They were ridiculously large. No where in the description does it say these pants run large so I ordered the same size of the dickies I buy at the store. I would have returned them but I needed my work pants right away and did not have time to go through the return and exchange process. Dealing with other companies before and understanding that not much can be done for compensation I just left it alone and lived with wearing these pants way too big. I don't have much free time and I work hard for my money. I don't make much money so when I spend my hard-earned money and invest it and something that I need I would assume that I would get what I thought I was ordering. I am only writing this review right now because I just received an email requesting my review on the specific item months later after my initial purchase. Other then being disappointed in the sizing these pants are great but I will not be ordering from the website anymore I probably won't buy any more dickies at all",

The thick material though didn't let the leg opening settle/soften down but it measures 8\" as it stated. The only thing I didn't like is the rise it's extremely low and believe me it's not new to me. But for the cut and what they are trying to market I don't think that low of a rise made any sense. I have fairly slim legs usually wear 6-7\" hem openings. So I ended up donating the pants to church. I'll guess I'll try the slim taper they have and pray it isn't too tight because of the thicker material",

I'm struggling to understand what kind of person would fit well in these, as someone with a slim build and almost no behind I don't see how anyone with a thicker build could comfortably wear these without these pants completely riding up their rear.

      "review_text": "Had to return the work pants because the zipper is only 3 inches long. That is way to short for a man. They need to be at least 5 inches long, otherwise a man would have to take his pants off just to urinate. We checked all of my husband's other pants and the zippers are at least 5 inches long. If you made them with longer zippers, we would buy them again. The material is so durable and easy to keep clean. My husband was a former insurance adjuster and these pants were part of his uniform.",
