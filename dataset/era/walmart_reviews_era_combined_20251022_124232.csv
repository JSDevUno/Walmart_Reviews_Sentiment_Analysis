The device pocket combo stitched behind the cargo pocket on the left hand side in genius! It fits my Samsung Galaxy S7 in an Otterbox case great and it i have not had a problem with it. Really a great design, only cargo jeans i can find so far that does this. Quality is great, i used one pair rigorously the summer of 2016 and by the end of the year no tears but small, not even pea sized holes started to emerge. From what they've been through it was defiantly worth the $20 for a single pant. I bought 3 more pairs for my company uniform this year. Doesn't seem to stain bad with grass/dirt, etc. Very happy purchase and will continue to buy them. Thanks Wrangler!",,False,0

The Coal Black on the other hand, are very tight. As all were ordered the same size and at the same time, I checked the sizing label to make sure all were as ordered. The Difference I found was the Indigo and Medium Stone called out 99% Cotton, 1% Spandex which is what the website description says whereas the Coal Black pair calls out 99% Cotton, 1% Elastane. Looking up ""Elastane"", it says it's another name for Spandex or Lycra. Something seems off as they don't fit. I really wanted a pair of Black Jeans comparable to fit of the blue ones but am now questioning if I was delivered the wrong pair of Coal Black Jeans or if I re-order, will they come as Cotton and Spandex or if I upsize, will I swim in them.

First, the denim is extremely lightweight, not what you expect if you have ever purchased wranglers before. Second, they cut the denim too short on the back pane of the front pockets, so the stitching and white pocket fabric pucker out no matter what - even when you're standing straight up. This was the case on both pockets for all four pair that I bought. I probably should have learned from the last time I bought Rustler jeans from Walmart.

Since NYX manufactures a good quality product at a great price, I felt this was a good place to start. Of the 5 colors I purchased my favorites are Slate which I have used as a liner and in the outer corner of my eyelid for a smoky eye, and Strawberry Milk which is my absolute favorite. It is the perfect highlighter for my skin tone. My only complaint is that when I went to retrieve it from my Muji, the shadow portion had somehow separated from the stick. I don't know why or how since I immediately put it in the Muji after using it. I took a tissue and gently pressed it back where it was supposed to be and after a couple of tries it finally seemed to work. Sparkle Nude is lovely as a shadow or highlighter. The color I looked forward to trying the most was Milk. I'm still playing with this one because I haven't gotten the result I was expecting when using it to make my shadows pop. I think I may be using too much or may need to forgo the shadow base I use before Milk to get the result I'm looking for. Milk is a pretty creamy white and I can see multiple uses for it. I also got Bronze which is okay; I actually prefer the Glam Shadow Stick I got in Fard Glamour because the color seems much richer and it really glides over my eyelid.

The brown and the blue are genius to use under brown or blue powder eyeshadows, as they really help the color come through (even in a smoky look) and they don't interfere too madly with blending. They also both work AMAZINGLY under duo-chrome brown and blue powder shadows -- they really help the two-tone effect pop. Seriously, try the brown under Mac Club. Just do it. As for the Milk, I love this pencil for priming under my eyes when I want to smoke out a look (but not look like a raccoon by 5 pm), and its also a brilliant primer for those days when I'm in a rush and I don't have time to fiddle around with brushes and eyeshadow base drying times and such like that. And if I'm in an even bigger rush, I've also just swiped the brown on my lid and spread it a bit with a concealer brush (and/ or finger) and it passes well as a one-and-done shadow/ liner, too.

My hands hurt.","I'll admit. I love the product inside the pencil. It works well as an eyeshadow base. However, I've had this for a pretty decent amount of time but nearly never use it. Why? Because I don't have the grip strength of a Burmese python holding onto a particularly delicious rat. I don't have the power of a fully grown silverback gorilla. I cannot twist with the force and fury of a thousand supernovae. Which seems to be a requirement to use more than just the little nubbin atop the pencil itself. I know there's more product in there. I have been scouring the internet for two hours trying to find an easier way to get at the sweet goodness of Jumbo Eye Pencil. But try as I might, it eludes me. Sharpening this thing is like trying to extract Excalibur from the stone. One must have the royal lineage of Camelot to experience the privilege of applying this. Even with the advice to freeze it, to use the NYX brand dual sided sharpener, to turn it just so, and to sell my soul to the Devil himself... I can't sharpen this. The callouses I have on my hands from years of opening up soda bottles have been shredded by this seemingly innocuous eye pencil. I am sitting in tears, one eye half finished, as my mangled pencil sits in the freezer yet again in the hopes of making it accessible to me. No one else in my house has conquered the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil, either. I know it is not just a moral failing on my part. In all seriousness, the design choice of using a smooth, semi-hard plastic instead of something like wood is, in my opinion, abysmal. I wasn't kidding about the callouses, or the fact that I am literally crying in frustration. Does anyone have any advice besides ""You can use a sharpener!"" because at this point I'm ready to painstakingly scrape it out and put it in a pot so I can apply it with a brush. I've learned that you can pry off the non-functional end of the pencil with pliers and push it out, so if the new sharpener I ordered doesn't work I'm gonna try that and give an update.

The formula feels light and moisturizing, not heavy and waxy at all, but there is good color payoff. That lightness of feeling comes at the cost of having to apply a little more frequently, but that's no big deal because it only goes where you put it so this isn't a messy, slippery, bleeding-outside-the-lines stick that requires a mirror and complicated reapplication of liner and the whole nine. Breeze resembles a $20 Origins shade I used to love, and the just-right level of sheen and feeling of moisture mean I don't have to apply a gloss topcoat. It's just plain pretty.
