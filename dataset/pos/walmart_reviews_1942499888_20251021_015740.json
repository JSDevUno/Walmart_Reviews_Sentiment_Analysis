I ordered this for the guest house at my Dads. The mattress in there was tagged April 2022, it's older than my daughter. This arrived mattress in 3 days. It set up fast. I slept like a baby, and I have a very expensive mattress at home. I'm looking at a king for my house now. I think this is better than my $3,500 mattress‚Ä¶insanity!",

The bed arrived packed inside the box better than anything g we've ever received. Once the many layers of plastic were removed, the bed began to expand. It took about 8 hours for it to achieve its maximum size. We ordered the 14‚Äù, but it's actually 13‚Äù. In the event we would need to return the bed, it is impossible to put it back in its box. Hopefully, this will continue to be a good purchase and serve us well.",

This first mattress I purchased was the brick (the firmest you can get) a few years ago and ended up putting the cooling foam topper and cloud quilted topper on it, also from Walmart/Allswell. The firmness level was perfect for my back but needed a little extra cushioning for my knees. This combination made my dream bed üõå üò¥. Still use this to this day!!! My most recent purchase was the supreme mattress, and it has a cooling attached topper, which is a must for Arizona üåµüî•!!! This is in a guest room and the comfort level is perfect!!! I am so happy with the affordability and comfort of both purchases and will be back for sure, this is my go to mattress place now. Thank you Allswell üòä",

      "review_text": "I was a skeptic buying a mattress from a company that was new to me. My skepticism was heightened when I found out that they were going to send this to me in a box, rolled up. I have bought other mattresses (e.g. Ikea) in a rolled up form and was not terribly impressed though it worked. My experience with the Allswell Supreme has truly changed my opinions and settled all of my skepticism. The package is heavy. There was no white glove delivery option due to COVID19. The shipping company (FedEx) driver was very careless and rough, destroyed the box. I complained to them for the treatment of the package. Thankfully the mattress itself was undamaged and was wrapped well inside. Getting it up the stairs was quite a feat, it is heavy and awkward. Once it was laid out on our box springs, it was extremely easy. Open up the package and let it air out for 48 hours and it was amazing! The mattress is very comfortable and hugs you a minute after you lay down. It is not an uncomfortable hug but just enough, the springs do not allow for a full sink in, it is perfect. The bed does not get hot at night. The sheets do have to be deep pocket sheets, the mattress is 14 inches. I woke up the next morning for the first time in years without pain in my shoulders and hips (side-sleeper). My fitbit recordings of my sleep have been excellent. My wife and I are so thankful we bought this mattress. It was incredibly reasonable with the Pre-Christmas sale that was running. Value price, Incredible quality, excellent product. I would recommend this to anyone. This mattress may have put my physical therapist and chiropractor out of business.",

Now this is someone who many years ago could smell a dirty diaper from three rooms away. So that is evidence that we experienced little to no off airing of the mattress. Living in FL we did have the luxury of opening our bedroom windows to air out any unpleasant odor. Our first night sleeping on this bed was just wonderful. If you have any reservations about purchasing this bed, forget about it, and order now. Our bed did not come with handles; however, when unboxing on the box springs they are not necessary.

We ended up sleeping on the mattress through the weekend and loved how comfortable it was! With a mattress covering and sheets, we weren't as bothered by the melted plastic. I sent an email to customer service, but never heard back, so I called Tuesday morning. Was never put on hold, was answered by the sweetest representative right away. She was able to pull up the pictures that I sent in my email and assured me this has never happened in the past. She placed a new order and we received another Supreme mattress that Friday. This time no melted plastic! It's been about a month now, and my husband and I LOVE our new mattress. Not sure how this will last for years to come, but right now, we are very happy with our purchase and the Allswell customer service.

      "review_text": "Don't let my 4 star rating (instead of a 5) mislead you. The Supreme Cal King mattress is an awesome product as well as an incredible value. This was my first experience with an on-line mattress and a \"Bed-in-a-Box\". My wife and I had no idea what to expect. The box came in severely damaged and we assumed the mattress would be damaged as well. The abundant wrapping and bagging protected the mattress from suffering any damage from the freight company mishandling. Because of the Covid-19 restrictions, the white glove option wasn't available. This means we had to remove our 20 year old traditional mattress and replace it with the new one ourselves. This was easier than I thought, but not for the feint of heart. The 'trick' is to place the bagged, compressed mattress in place and open an entire end of the mattress bag. the mattress will decompress and you can incrementally work the bag off of the mattress. Sadly, we didn't have the mattress oriented properly, so we had to turn the mattress. This wasn't excessively difficult. It's difficult to to select a mattress on-line. We need a firmer mattress so we thought a medium to firm rating would suffice. Sadly, this wasn't the case. Keep in mind, the firmness ratings differ from retailer to retailer. A firm rating at one site seems to be a medium at another. Another consideration is a hybrid mattress (springs and foam) is quite different from an older traditional mattress. The foam takes some getting used to. To my dismay, this isn't something I could adjust to, even after more than two weeks on the mattress. I'm a tall person with back and knee issues. The foam supported my entire body, but didn't offer the overall alignment I need to prevent back pain. Perhaps one of the other mattresses could, but as an old dog that's not ready for new tricks, I think I'm going to stick with a more traditional mattress. I still think the quality of the mattress is surprisingly good, and the value is spectacular. If you are of normal height and weight, this could be the mattress for you.",

      "review_text": "Terrific value. Nice mattress. It's just a tad soft for my taste. The description is \"medium firm\". I didn't dare go any more firm because I don't care for too firm a mattress. From my perspective I might describe it as medium. I'm pretty happy overall with it, and will likely adjust with no complaints. The edge stiffness is wonderful and accommodates sitting on the edge of the bed nicely. It's one of the perils of on-line shopping/ordering. With no real option to \"test\" you kind of live with what you get, since returning a mattress is WAY to much of an ordeal.",

I have always needed a topper with previous mattresses, but not with this one, it was perfect out of the box. If you are looking for something really firm, this may not be for you, but for all others I would say try it. Most comfortable mattress I have ever used. The second pleasant surprise was the complete lack of any noticeable off-gassing, something which I really don't like. Right out of the box this mattress was as neutral as any organic brand. Overall super-pleased, happy to give 5 star review, telling all my friends.",

This mattress is FIRM and it's difficult to see why they call this a \"hybrid.\" I had my roommate sit on it and my boyfriend slept on it and they both agree that it is too firm. The memory foam on top only kicks in a while after you've sat on it, but it's barely any give. The height is perfect and the material is nice but I just can't work with how firm it is. Even when you punch the bed, it is SUPER hard. After the first night I woke up completely sore but I thought it was from moving into my new apartment. But now, it has been a full week and I am buying a memory foam mattress topper because 1) I don't want to go through the hassle of returning this and 2) I don't want to have to research and wait to get a different one. Only get this mattress if you are looking for FIRM support.",

I'm 27 and a nurse and mom to a young toddler, my back was aching every day with my 8 year old traditional spring+pillow top mattress. I was doing most everything in my power to feel better, but nothing was helping... for months! I decided it was time for a mattress upgrade. From night 1 I noticed a difference. A few weeks later and I just noticed- no more ibuprofen, and heating pads every evening... I feel great! The only thing I can attribute it to is this new mattress. I'm still working just as hard and playing just as hard with my baby, but my back feels great! Some added bonuses I wasn't looking for but am loving: very minimal motion transfer- I can't even tell with my partner gets up, or even moves in the bed unless he's directly touching me. Also I had been warned about the smells with bed in the box, and I hardly even noticed any off-gasing smells at all. Maybe the first night, if you shoved your face into the bed, you could smell a slight chemically smell. But it wasn't bad or overpowering, kinda like a sharpie smell? Definitely didn't take long to disappear. Overall, would definitely recommend!",

It does run a little bit warm but it is winter now so I am not noticing it much. I am interested in seeing how it does in the summer months. I am always happy to lay down in bed.

Got it all straightened out and another mattress sent and received within a week. The box it arrived in was notsealed well. The tape on what should have been the \"bottom\" of the box, based on the arrows, was completely unsealed - all flaps could open. Thankfully, nothing was damaged and the tape on the rest of the box held. I give this only so the shipping tape, etc. can be improved upon for your future shipments. The mattress - GREAT!! My husband's word \"I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud\"; it is really comfortable and especially since we both sleep on our sides alot. We're \"technically\" seniors (don't \"think\" as a senior), so every once in a while these joints can get \"tricky\" in the shoulders and lower back - no problems so far - love it!",

As for the comfort level, it's definitely good so far. nice and firm when laying down but with a little cushion on the top. it's too soft for our preference at this time, but we were previously on a firm foam mattress so it's an adjustment that will need more time to see if its the best fit.

I've been falling asleep faster and sleeping all night most nights compared to waking several times per night trying to get comfortable with my old mattress.
