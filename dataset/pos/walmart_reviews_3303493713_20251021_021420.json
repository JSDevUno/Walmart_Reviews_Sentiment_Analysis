If I let the cell phone deplete close to zero and plug the power bank to both charge and continue to use the phone, then I might get 1.5 charge during one day. In this case current drawn is 1.8A. Also performance decrese below 12oC (55F) and charge time increase. Below 0oC (32F) it's useless for high drain applications. It might still be usefull for load below 0.5A.",

      "review_text": "It Gets the Job Done, But Nothing Special I bought this power bank mainly for traveling and daily backup charging. It works fine for the most part — it charges my phone about 1.5 times on a full charge, which is decent but not amazing for the size. It's not the fastest when it comes to recharging itself either, so you have to plan ahead. The build quality is alright — feels a bit plasticky but hasn't given me any trouble so far. The size is pocket-friendly, which I like, and it's light enough to carry around in my bag. Overall, it's an okay backup option, but I wouldn't rely on it for heavy use or long trips. If you just need something basic for emergencies, this does the trick. --- If you'd like, I can tailor it to a specific model or your actual experience — just let me know!",

Ain't no way in heck a 20,000 battery should have gone through 25% of its charge for 5% phone battery. Have 8000mah batteries that gave almost two full charges before being empty. Second, it does not support fast charging or type c to type c charging. Must rely on slower, outdated USB ports. 3rd, both batteries make this God awful whining sound when charging.
