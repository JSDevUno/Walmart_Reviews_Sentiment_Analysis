They said take it back like this was a book or something smh…I will NEVER buy anything from GTRacing again, their customer service sucks and their design sucks!

Wheels are way better than my last gaming chair. Took 20-30 minutes to put together. Not difficult, but a handful of bolts to be hand tightened with the included tools. Glad I got the new chair. Probably won't last for more than a few years, but for the money I spent, that's acceptable.",

You have to wiggle pretty aggressively to return it back out of the way. Furthermore the arm rests come with covers that cover the nails to tighten the arms, makes the design look sleek, however dot com, it makes it more challenging to tighten the arms as frequently as it needs. That all being said, my cats enjoy stealing it from me and it was comfortable for the meantime but I had to replace it already with something a little better and actually cheaper!",

Amazon, Best Buy had nothing that could be shipped to me in a short amount of time. So, I checked Walmart, and they had the GTRACING GTWD-200 gaming chair in-stock and could pick it up that day. The chair costs approximately $125.00 including tax; excellent value. It took approximately 30 to 35 minutes to assemble, and it comes with the tool to assemble the chair, so no extra tools needed. It is very comfortable and is great for big guys. The chair has plenty of room to sit comfortably and has multiple adjustments to reach your comfort zone. Overall, great value for the money and I recommend.",

I've only owned it for about a month but it has shown 0 sign of slowing down. - easy to assemble - good quality for this price compared to competitors - the footrest is strong enough to last a little but don't expect something durable especially if you're weighing over 190lbs. - as with most 'gaming' chairs, headrest is basically useless as well as the lumbar support but it's not uncomfortable by any means. - It doesn't lean back that far so beware, but I suspect this is to help keep it durable for longer. - Hard to beat at this price, it's about as comfortable as some much more expensive chairs but it's certainly not winning points on overall material quality in comparison. - Great beginner chair IMO or if you need something reasonably comfortable for cheap",

Not even an hour after assembling one of the arms felt loose. Under further inspection it had to do with the “bolt” out the one side that you would screw into. The bolt came loose and when unzipped the cover my husband discovered the weld broke. He was able to sort of fix by drilling a hole in the metal piece and put an additional bolt to anchor. The look of the chair is nice and the features offered are good but another issue is the reclining feature doesn't seem “stable”. What I mean is that if you even slightly lean back the chair will keep reclining. Just beware.",

It was fairly easy to assemble and I had assistance so it took about 45 mins to assemble with care. If the chair did not lean to one side, I'm sure it would be a great chair.

It looks nice and fits well behind my desk. Cons: The arms aren't adjustable and not in the best place for my body size, but they're not terrible. The paddles for adjusting the recline is a bit out of reach, so I keep grabbing the one that lowers me down instead. Wish it was a bit closer to the front. Attaching the lumbar and head pillows was a bit of a pain and don't adjust as well as I'd like. The straps are cheaply made so it'll probably snap off eventually. I had to use another pillow for lumbar as the one it came with isn't great. Overall though I like the chair and have less back problems now compared to my old chairs.",

As someone who spends hours gaming, working, or just chilling at my desk, comfort is a huge deal. This chair nails it with its adjustable pillows that perfectly support my neck and back—no more post-session aches for me! The upholstered cushion is super comfy, making those extended gaming sessions feel like a breeze. What I absolutely love is the ergonomic footrest and the reclining feature that allows me to kick back and relax in style. It's not just about comfort; this chair makes my gaming space look more modern and sleek. It's sturdy too, handling up to 290 pounds with ease, and the customizable features like seat height, headrest, and lumbar pillow adjustments are top-notch. I can tweak everything to fit just right, which is a big plus. Overall, investing in this chair was a smart move. It's enhanced my gaming experience significantly and also doubled up as a comfy spot for work. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their seating!",

Even our CNA loves this chair, that is here during the day! The price was very reasonable, very well constructed, easy to assemble. We recommend this chair!",

Overall it's really comfortable and you can adjust/ lock the back in position. Great for sitting straight up or leaning back a little bit (or all the way back). It's sturdy so either option and you still feel well supported.",

Also, it is actually not a foot rest but more of a place to rest your thighs as it does not extend to the feet, which is what a foot rest should do. The arm rests should be adjustable upwards to actually make contact with the elbows. Currently, they sit too low if you're working at a desk and provide no real purpose.",

The last flaw is the recline lever is away short and tucked into far making hard to reach and adjust while sitting. It could have used more padding in the seat. My bad the footrest is 100% garbage its to short and not supported strong enough. other than that good chair for beginners or someone on a budget",

I wanted to be comfortable and have some flexibility to stretch. I enjoyed setting up the chair; the instructions were clear. It felt like a puzzle. However, the quality of the material is not what I expected. The leather looks cheap, and I dont think it is durable. The color of the black leather is different for each part, which also makes it look cheap. The wheels don't feel safe; it gets off from adjusting myself to the table. It is not securely attached. The footrest also doesn't feel safe. like if I put in a little weight, it might actually cause me to lose balance, which will also push wheels out. Overall, I think the chair is not worth the money, and it is probably not even safe to use it.",

      "title": "Nice chair and really comfy! Well built",
      "review_text": "After reading tons and tons of reviews I finally settled on this one for my 15 year old 6'2\" son who has a habit of leaning back in chairs and just went through a (bad) brand new one he got for Christmas from Walmart with super cruddy support bars in the lower back area that were not even properly welded. Literally just tack welded. Needless to say, that 4 month old chair is garbage now. Very flimsy and not well built. I set out on a search for a better built chair with better back support bracing and more comfortable. He spends alot of time in his chair for homeschooling and also gaming so I decided on this one and it has a very wide support bracing in the back area where teens have a habit of leaning back in the chair. Much better. I was pleased to see this. This chair is very comfortable and the back comes up nice and high and I love how the sides feel like they sort of wrap around your body and offer support. It's good and roomy and the wheels are nice and smooth and it came with a support pillow for your neck and low back. He put it together himself in about 20 minutes. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this chair again. Infact, I am about to purchase a second chair for my daughter who is also homeschooling and spends alot of time in a chair and needs a good comfortable chair and this is a great choice. I am big on reading reviews and found them extremely helpful for me when I was searching for this one so I hope this review helps someone else who is in search for a great chair.",

They're good quality chairs with various options and color choices and they work for the \"gamer\" chair look while also offering some actual comfort for extended office use. The footrest is a nice little addition and for the price you really can't beat these chairs. Feels like I'm getting one of the $500 chairs for 1/4 that price.",

Not ideal for my desk that is lower. Also it does not budge or rock. Once you set the back, it has to stay there. You lock it and it won't budge and if unlocked, you just fall all the way back. Too shift for my liking. Also the foot rest is a pain or pull out and push away. It does not glide easy. Otherwise the chair is fine. I personally would not get it again.",

Like the female adapter is not attached to anything. I can't even un screw it it just spins in place.. It took 5 minutes to get the headrest cover zipped up. Honestly this chair is garbage.
