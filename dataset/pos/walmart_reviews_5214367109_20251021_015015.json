It looks absolutely beautiful but it is just alittle heavy when filled up. I would expect that though because any cast iron pot that's good is going to be heavy. I'm hoping it will be as durable as the one my mother had most of my life and I am 68. Thanks for selling quality cookware.",

Had plenty of liquid but I kept feeling something catching a at the bottom. When everything was finished, I kept seeing blackish bits through the food but I thought it was from the ingredients. Well, time for washing and the entire bottom is black with pasta noodles and broccoli that burned. This time it wouldn't come out. I soaked this pot for 2 days. IT STILL DOESN'T COME OUT.

Two durable handles made lifting easy. Cooking was fantastic!!! No sticking, no burning, steam stayed within!! Cleanup was AMAZINGLY easy.

I have used a 3-4 times in the last 3 weeks, always hand washing it and being careful because it's so heavy. Somehow the inside lid has lost its enamel coating on several of the dots and there's a chip on the outside bottom, I have no idea how this could have happened and I'm so disappointed. Sure hope that enamel didn't fall in my cooking.",

I had a chat conversation from a very helpful man and he was honest and answered all of my questions. I asked if all of the BCP items are made in China and he said, yes. He said some things are assembled in the USA. Since this is a cast iron Dutch oven, it is 100% made in China. I'm disappointed that BCP doesn't include this information on the website descriptions. I noticed there are several questions on the Dutch oven asking where it is made and there are no answers.I prefer to buy products made in the USA. I do hope this review makes it to the website.

Last night I made risotto and sadly watched as a huge chip flaked off the bottom of the pot. I'm super bummed because I loved the color and feel of this product before it chipped and became unusable.

      "review_text": "This dutch oven is amazing and cooks superbly! I have been huntinting for the ideal dutch oven on a budget! Love the porcelain finish! Other dutch ovens I remember at it's price point didn't the beutiful white smooth interior but a black one (At least one had it not only black, but rough and not-so-smooth.)! Thr lid fits very well on top and has those spikes that help it \"rain\" moisture to help make dishes mouthwateringly delicious! The color I got was a pretty blue that looks good in our kitchen. I love that it's oven safe up to 480° F which is I imagine is perfect for virtually every recipe of no-knead bread recipe out there. Besides this, there were dutch ovens that were up to 500°, but I don't remember any of them having all the other desired features besides high temperature at it's price point! Move over LeCreuset! From what I've seen, this trumps all the other enameled dutch ovens at or below it's price range whether it be The Lodge, Tramortina (Cheaper, had a whopping 6.5 quart capacity, and a color similar to mine, but had a measly 450° Oven Safe Temp and small handles!), Amazon Basics (Oven safe to only 400°, are you for real?!), or Uno Casa. The only other oven that I remember that seemed to compete with it was the Puricon, which was oven safe up to a whopping 540°! However, it was only 5 1/2 quarts compared to my 6 quart Best Choice! In the end I preferred 1/2 quart more of capacity than the super high temperature (What recipe is there out there that requires such a high heat tolerance?!)! We've already used it to cook mexican pork cooked with tomato and onion as well as potatos and turned out amazing! This will become our little kitchen workhorse that will last us for years, probably decades to come (I can just feel it!)! I wouldn't be surprised if it gets passed down through the family generation after generation! Move over LeCreuset and don't get too cocky! There's a new kid in town and his name is Best Choice! He brings quality and dependance at a much lower price!",
