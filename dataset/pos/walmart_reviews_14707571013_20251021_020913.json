And the phone only comes with the charging cable, not the outlet cube, so this was literally perfect timing as I have no other usb-c chargers. I was initially surprised at how small the charger is (see picture with hand for size reference), but it is small but mighty! I love the compact design, as I can take this charger with me anywhere. I throw it in my work bag, bring it in my car and have even used it in the small space between the outlet and our sofa. I love that the portion that plugs into the wall can be folded up back into the charger, helping its compact size. My usb-c charging cable works perfectly with this, and my phone charges very fast. I've really found great use and have been loving this compact usb-c charger! Overall I definitely recommend, especially if you're on the go and need a charger that you can bring with you anywhere!",

I did exactly that, and I can't say my or my husband's (brand new) phones charged noticeably faster than any of the other, standard \"fast\" chargers out there or in here.
