      "review_text": "I've been using this Onn wall charger for a few weeks, and it's a solid addition to my gadget lineup. It has two ports—one standard USB-A and one USB-C for newer iPhones—and pushes out 32 W of power. It's not as beefy as my 120 W original Apple charger, but it still charges my iPhone to 100 % in about 30 minutes. The plastic shell wraps around all four sides, giving it a clean, elegant look, and the white finish feels classy. The foldable plug makes it easy to toss in a bag when I travel. The only downside is that it doesn't support higher wattage or Power Delivery required for laptops, but for everyday use, it's stylish and does the job well.",

The charger features a 20W USB-C port with Power Delivery, allowing for fast charging of compatible devices. I can charge my phone up to 50% in about 30 minutes, which is quite convenient. The additional 12W USB-A port is handy for charging a second device simultaneously, though at a slower rate. One aspect I appreciate is its compact design, making it easy to carry around. However, I noticed that it doesn't have folding prongs, which would have been a nice feature for travel. Overall, for its price point, the Onn Dual-Port Charger offers solid performance and convenience. It's a great option for those looking for an affordable charger that can handle multiple devices.",

The photo showed me the one I ordered was what I had borrowed. If I had gone to the store to buy it, it would have been in a box without a picture just a word description and not knowing exactly what I needed the time involved to buy it in the store picking exactly what I needed would have frustrated me.

I love that it has the two different ports and I also love that the plug folds down for ease of packing. It's well made and very sturdy. I am very impressed with the \"fast charge\" and feel that is accurate. The only thing, and it could be just me misunderstanding the wording on the package, is the LED lighting. I tried it in different lighting and didn't see an LED light anywhere. That said, I don't care at all about that (I don't need a nightlight in my hotel room), so I'm not going to reduce my overall rating for that. It could easily be a fault in this unit that doesn't have any bearing on how it functions and honestly, I'm happier without the light. It has been a great charger and it is currently in my travel bag awaiting a trip this weekend!",
