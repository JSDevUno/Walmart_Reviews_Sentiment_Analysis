The last towels I purchased was a name brand but they do not absorb any water and you feel cold just trying to dry off. So after reading one person's review on what her mother did I tried to copy that step by step and I love how they came out. I may not have everything she said in her directions but for the most part....first put them in a cool dryer for four or five cycles to get rid of most of the fluff. Then wash with (I used cold water) half cup vinegar. Then dry as normal. They came out wonderful. Soft fluffy and absorbent. And I did the before and after test as shown by the manufacturer. They did actually almost doubled in size after that one wash. Oh, I did not mention, do not use fabric softener. Enjoy!",

I took it home, washed it first (didn't find any lint balls like some people said although it did shed a lot in the dryer on medium heat) and then I took a shower. That's when I knew it wasn't for me. It smeared the water around instead of absorbed it. Just like all the rest. I have old towels from the 70's and 80's that when you use them the water is GONE when you wipe. They ABSORB moisture. This one didn't do that.

The towels feel more plush on each side which sounds like it would be great but it is not at all. While cozy, they’re so plush that they don’t seem to wick moisture away as easily as their predecessors. I don’t want to be in bed with my towel blanketing me so coziness only goes so far. I like the previous bath sheet that had differing terry construction on each side. One was more flat - though looped and terry - and the other side a bit more cozy but not to the level of the newest version. The color didn’t meet the image advertised. I was expecting what one may call a muted teal. I rec’d something closer to a medium blue with a tinge of teal. Perhaps that sounds the same. To the eye, it just isn’t except to the eyes of my spouse who is color-blind. It is not a horrible color - it’s nice - just doesn’t meet the advertised image. I hope BHG returns to their previous construction. I love my bath sheets most when they make it easy to dry my body. Who knew that would be the expectation? lol",

Better quality than some of the towels I've paid more for at other stores. No loose threads, or skipped loops, tight weave, and wonderful to touch.

They were so soft when I received them and they were still pretty soft after washing and drying. They did shed a lot of lint and I had to clean the trap out twice, but that was not an issue for me, new towels are normally like that at first until you've washed them a few times. They fluffed up very nicely and they are not too thick nor too thin in my opinion. I think they are absolutely beautiful and they look expensive at a cheaper price than most places! They look amazing in my linen closet and have a salon/spa vibe to them! If you just got married or moved to a new place and you need quality and affordable towels that look and work great, I would 100% recommend these!!!",

We plan to buy some for us! I washed them on the gentle cycle and dry them in the dryer so they're fluffy and not stiff and they do give off a good amount of lint in the dryer and some on my daughter's body when drying but its okay, it comes off later on as the day goes by and shes dry.

I like to rotate my towels every few years or as needed. The description sounded promising and offering good quality. However, I was very surprised how soft these were, right out of the box. The description mentioned how “extremely soft and fluffy” they were, and they truly are. I have washed them 2 times using laundry soap and bleach and they remained just as soft and fluffy. I hate to say it, but I can defiantly feel the difference between these new towels and my older towels. They are also thick and very absorbent. I use the Hand Towle for the guest bathroom and my guest even commented on how soft the hand towel was. I have always purchased white towels because of the ability to always use bleach to wash them, but sometime the bleach tends to add roughness to the texture of my towels, but I can pleasantly say that these towels continue to be very soft. I plan to purchase more of these towels as I change out and rotate my towels. I highly recommend these towels.",

It is very soft and fluffy and has a nice thickness to it. However, the only thing I wasn't happy with is that I don't find it to be as absorbent as I personally like a towel to be, and even after a few washes, it didn't seem to get more absorbent. I think for most people, it will work just fine and it has some great features that will appeal to others. It is fade resistant and has low lint. It has an Intellifresh freshness protection that keeps it smelling fresh over time. It has PureLOFT technology that makes the towel loftier after the first few laundry cycles in the washer and dryer. It's a pretty standard sized bath towel at 30 inches by 56 inches. I love the silver color and it looks great with a lot of décor. I like the simple stitching design pattern because it's just enough to give it a little bit of interest, but doesn't seem overpowering to be able to pair with other towels or décor. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a unique towel with some features, that is a simple design to match most décor!",

      "review_text": "I was actually very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this towel! I love a good bargain in most cases but I am very particular about the towels I buy because I want them to be soft, absorbent, and last for a very long time. I usually get pretty pricey ones from a department store so I have to be honest that I just wasn't expecting this towel to be as nice as it seems so far. It was completely unabsorbent and frustrating after the first two washes but starting after the third wash it has an incredible texture and so far, after five washes, I haven't seen any loose threads or pulling/misshapen areas. The color is very pretty, sort of a slate grey blue, and the waffle texture looks pretty hanging in the bathroom. I wash my towels with all natural odor removing detergent after every second shower so I haven't really noticed or had this one long enough to know if the \"Intellifresh TM Freshness Protection\" really does anything to help but I do like the idea of it. It's also very important to me that it's made with USA grown cotton. If it was organic cotton it would absolutely be a five star towel. I really prefer organic cotton so I'm on the fence about whether I'll buy more or not but I would absolutely recommend them to anyone who isn't quite as concerned about that.",

I am recovering from a foot injury, so walking through a parking lot and big box store is challenging for me. I'd seen these at a friend's house and liked them, so I ordered four bath towels online. I received three bath towels and one bath sheet in error, so I started the exchange process online. One of the return options was to send the towel back through a FedEx Office location. I checked, and there were several including one in my town, so I chose that option (again, trying to avoid going to the next town and dealing with the Walmart parking lot and store). The next screen only gave me limited FedEx Office locations, the closest being in that Walmart I was trying to avoid. At that point, I couldn't go back and change my return option. So, I brought the bath sheet to my Walmart on the next Saturday, only to discover that the FedEx Office in the Walmart is only open limited hours on weekdays, meaning I will have to do all of that again on Monday and rush to make the hours after work. If I had a lot of free time and if I weren't recovering, this would STILL be an annoying inconvenience. Next time, I will use Amazon.",

The bath towel is a generous size and dries pretty quickly. I love the pattern as well. The detail in the stripes and the trim along the bottom are a nice touch. The hand towel is being used in our powder room/guest bathroom because it looks so nice! These look and feel well-made and would definitely make a great engagement, bridal, or housewarming gift.",

The strip ripping in the BATH towel pattern, makes it look fresh and modern looking. Once you wash, it looks brand new again. It's so nice to have a HAND towel to match the bath towel for show, and to just grab to use for Hand washing for fast drying.
