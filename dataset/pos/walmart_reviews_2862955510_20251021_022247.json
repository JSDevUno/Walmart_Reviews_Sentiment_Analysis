Our security cameras have the entire event recorded. I called Walmart.com Monday and was promised my money would be refunded. it has not. Called Estes today 15 days later explaining there is no record on Walmart.com of them even picking the item up. I was told just wait 24-48hrs and I can contact Walmart back.

      "review_text": "I really, really wanted to love this chair, but I don't and can't! This chair is beautiful, but it is sooo uncomfortable! The gray fabric is rough - really, truly rough. Nothing soft about it at all! I read all the reviews before I bought it and figured those who said it's rough were just being nitpicky. They were not! It's rough and uncomfortable to the point that I can only sit on it if I have a blanket over it. And it is*not* the perfect chair for a reading nook! The back is way too short to settle in and get comfy to read. I have to slouch way down and pile up the pillows just right behind my head for support, and it's still not comfortable. I can, however, see that this would be a great chair (or chairs, if you need multiples) for a sitting/conversation area where everyone will be sitting upright and, presumably, fully dressed. It has a maximum load weight of 225 lbs, so many big and/or tall people will exceed the weight limit. Something to consider if you're purchasing it to have company over. The instructions say you must have two or more people to assemble it, but I have janky shoulders and was able to assemble it by myself, so two people aren't absolutely necessary. I don't necessarily not recommend it, but I only recommend it for certain situations. This is not the chair for snuggling in for a cold, rainy day of reading and relaxing.",

The chairs are attractive and are reasonably priced. At first, we also found them relatively cozy. However, as time has gone on we have come to the conclusion that these are the most uncomfortable chairs we have ever owned. The seat bottom is extremely hard. We thought the bottoms might soften somewhat over time, but they have not. My wife has taken to sitting on a pillow when using the chair. In addition, the back being composed of three separate pillows seems like a good idea, but in practice it's a pain (literally). Every shift in position requires moving the pillows and it's difficult to find a consistently comfortable position. The back/pillows are also relatively low, meaning there is inadequate back support. Finally, the seat height is low. If you use the chair with an ottoman, your feet tend to be higher than your backside, resulting in an awkward sitting position. We have given up trying to make due with these chairs and are currently looking for new ones.",

For my bedroom aesthetic, I wanted the FAWN color, but it was chronically out of stock until, in the middle of one random night, I checked, and it was in! I ordered two of them immediately. They shipped quickly, and I got them within a few days. Set up was great, no issues. The size, look and comfort are exceptional. I was a little iffy about getting a corduroy chair, but it looks really cool and the fabric is very soft.. I wanted a chair that my husband would be comfortable in, and this one is perfect. As other reviewers had noted, there is a pink or mauve undertone in the FAWN color. But it is definitely more tan or beige than pink and, depending on lighting, you donâ€™t see the pink at all. These chairs are perfect to watch the sunrise from our bedroom window and swivel around to watch the morning news. Super practical and literally beautiful.",

I want to note the corded look is nice! I just donâ€™t find it working for my space. Overall assembly was easy and again the couch itself is soft and comfortable, but the color didnâ€™t meet expectations which is why I didnâ€™t give it full stars.

I tried calling her back, but the number could not be reached. back and forth with CS from walmart and CS fedex, no chair, but we are sorry for your inconvenience. It was stated over and over, day after day, until I realized no chair would be coming. Fedex failed walmart, and walmart failed me. I'm sure the chair would have been beautiful, and the price was excellent for those lucky enough to receive it. now, if walmart shipped with ups, I would be sitting in my chair and enjoying it. UPS delivers in my neck of the woods. Fedex allows its drivers to decide where and if a delivery is fit to be moved. I'm old enough to remember when K-mart was king and wal-mart was an infant. you are king now walmart how much longer will you rein.

They have ZERO record of this being delivered. Itâ€™s also interesting that upon dispute of this, Federal Express actually went into their system and changed important details of the delivery, including the actual delivery date. They clearly are in error and at fault. I wonder why this isnâ€™t being taken up with your actual delivery service Federal Express, as I see these chairs being offered all over Facebook Marketplace in my area, new and in box at reduced rates. You have to wonder if they are being stolen by actual Federal Express workers and then re-sold. I should not and will not dispute this with my bank. Your staff already told me on a phone call yesterday that I was being sent a new chair. So, are you now telling me Walmart is now not standing by what was already promised to me? You can refer back to that call that took place yesterday. I am sure it was recorded. I was told that a replacement would be sent between Jan 11 and Feb 11, and I would receive an email confirmation, which I have yet to receive. Would you like to speak to the package delivery service, which is provided by my building to confirm that ZERO package was delivered here. Walmart chose to deliver a $300 plus item without getting signature confirmation or even a photograph of where it was delivered. Even Amazon does that. That was NOT my choice. This fault falls on Walmart and Federal Express and I should and will receive a refund from Walmart for an item that was not received. Margo Osborne",

I assembled them by myself and it took about 20 minutes for the first one and a little shorter on the second. No problems with damaged boxes and the packaging was great! Delivery time was very fast, with my order being placed late on December 1 and delivery on December 5!

Wouldnâ€™t have ordered if I knew it was going to go to free shipping. Canâ€™t return to get shipping cost back. Customer service rep I talked to was nice but they couldnâ€™t help me since Walmart wouldnâ€™t let them lol. Love the chair, not so much Walmart. Probably wonâ€™t order from Walmart.com for furniture again. So if youâ€™re wanting to order the chair and it has a shipping fee, just be patient until it goes to free shipping.",

I was hoping the chair would be in my new apartment before Christmas, but will now be here most likely after. I have no words!",

I realized that out of the thousands of chairs shipped there are going to be a few unhappy people. But everything mentioned in the 1 reviews were not true for my experience. The chair was in pristine condition in solid packaging and very easy to assemble. And it not only looks stunning but welcomes anyone to curl up in it with a good book or just to relax.",
