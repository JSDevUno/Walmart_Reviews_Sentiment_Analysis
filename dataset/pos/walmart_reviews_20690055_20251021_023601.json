The 'ironing board' legs make it very accessible to wheelchairs etc., as well as the adjustable height positioning. It seems very durable, not likely to break. Neutral in color & easy to clean. However those with limited hand strength may have a problem with the 'squeeze trigger' mechanism for height adjustment. Confined to a chair, I had to fumble with it a bit before getting it set. But its fairly lightweight & the legs snap lock when its folded for storage. There are plastic end caps on the legs so they don't scratch the floor.

I missed it greatly, so just bought this one for myself (Again). Love, love this table. It is so easy to collapse and move. Light weight enough to move easily, but very sturdy when I want to put my 32\" monitor and laptop on it to do some extra work. It is fabulous for working on crafts from my chair in front room while hubby is watching TV and doesn't want to \"be by himself\".",

The table is very sturdy and has taken a lot of abuse over the years. In fact I am using it right now for my laptop. If you need a portable workspace that does not take up much room this is the table for you. Many of my coworkers have purchased tables similar but they either complain about them or have had them break after a few years. Great product!",
