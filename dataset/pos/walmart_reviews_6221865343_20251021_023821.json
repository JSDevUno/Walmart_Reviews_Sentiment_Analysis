And don't even bother contacting the Billiing Dept as you'll just get hung up on. When I ordered this Barrel, the same one I had ordered before, along with 2 bags of Potting Mix, the delivery photo clearly showed only 2 items not the 3 items I paid Walmart for, yet they refuse to check the photo which is supposed to be the \"Proof\" though no longer do, as Walmart will not even refund when you have the delevery people themselves tell Wallmart the item was missing. Ordering this item was a repeated attempt that resulted in paying for an item I never recieved, not worth being disrespected every time I contacted Walmart, and this has been going on often, and to others in my area recently with online delivery orders. Therefore we do not recommend ordering this item, better to go in person to purchase it, though who wants to buy from a store who is not trustworthy online with your money!",
