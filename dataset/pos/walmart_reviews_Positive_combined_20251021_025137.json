It really helps me to sit more upright, which my chiropractor likes. And it eliminates any strain on my arms or hands from holding a heavy book up. It was completely assembled whit arrived, so I appreciate that there was nothing to put together. I'm enjoying this very much %26 highly recommend it. 😊",

          "title": "Nothing but frustration and bruises",
          "review_text": "FIRST LOOK: No instructions, but the assembly seems simple enough. STRIKE 1: One of the plastic blocks to keep things from sliding off when you have the table portion angled is too large to slide into the hole like the other one it came with %26 is also filthy like coffee was spilled , staining it- and looks used. Was this a defective returned product that they decided to re-sell without checking the functionality of it? STRIKE 2: You cannot have the table angled if you're sitting on a bed or couch because the entire table becomes top-heavy %26 falls towards you. I had no intention of sitting on the floor to use this, so this issue is frustrating. STRIKE 3: The plastic drawer is essentially useless . It doesn't slide well, requiring quite a bit of force to open and close. You can already see plastic shavings spiraling off when you try to use it %26 I only tested it out for setup. It wouldn't last long if I tried to use it regularly- or occasionally for that matter. STRIKE 4: One of the spring-loaded clips for height adjustment won't stay locked in the place I want it. Also- I smacked my thumbs MULTIPLE times on the other clip (for adjusting angle) when I was trying to get it to lock in like the other side does. No luck, so it won't allow proper height adjustment either. Frustrated by how often I hurt my thumbs (as mentioned above), as well as smacking my knees repeatedly when trying to flip it over to adjust it when upright wasn't working … the number of injuries/bumps %26 bruises is absolutely ridiculous! I could get better functionality from a cardboard box with a couple books inside to weigh it down: at least with that setup it wouldn't be top-heavy and I wouldn't have to worry about it falling towards me. I suppose that it's my fault for believing that this cheaper option could be useful at all. Returning ASAP %26 buying the more expensive option %26 hoping that it's more functional. Otherwise, that cardboard box idea is looking even more appealing.",

They've never failed on me, but you really don't have to push the button to be able to adjust them. It's almost like the lock hole is just a little too big. I can raise the height without having to push the button but, on the flip side, you will have to push them to lower it. I would still recommend it. Good product for the price.",

It was wrapped snuggly inside three boxes to protect it! I love the large side handles! It will be so easy to grasp with my oven gloves. I have a 12qt Dutch oven and the handles are smaller than this one. Kudos to whom ever designed it with large handles.",

When it arrived, I lifted approximately over 20lbs of well constructed cast iron material sealed in a bubbleless, smooth finish. The lid had a rubber seal around the top allowing a quiet close. Two durable handles made lifting easy. Cooking was fantastic!!! No sticking, no burning, steam stayed within!! Cleanup was AMAZINGLY easy. I purchased an additional two as gifts and a second for myself. I would definitely recommend this oven to others! BCP best purchase again!! JW",

I had a chat conversation from a very helpful man and he was honest and answered all of my questions. I asked if all of the BCP items are made in China and he said, yes. He said some things are assembled in the USA. Since this is a cast iron Dutch oven, it is 100% made in China. I'm disappointed that BCP doesn't include this information on the website descriptions. I noticed there are several questions on the Dutch oven asking where it is made and there are no answers.I prefer to buy products made in the USA. I do hope this review makes it to the website. If not, I will no longer buy from BCP. The Dutch oven is a gorgeous blue color.",

Last night I made risotto and sadly watched as a huge chip flaked off the bottom of the pot. I'm super bummed because I loved the color and feel of this product before it chipped and became unusable. For reference i was always using wooden or silicone cooking tools on this dutch oven, and I didn't use it above the heat recommended. hopefully I will find a replacement that doesn't chip.",

          "review_text": "This dutch oven is amazing and cooks superbly! I have been huntinting for the ideal dutch oven on a budget! Love the porcelain finish! Other dutch ovens I remember at it's price point didn't the beutiful white smooth interior but a black one (At least one had it not only black, but rough and not-so-smooth.)! Thr lid fits very well on top and has those spikes that help it \"rain\" moisture to help make dishes mouthwateringly delicious! The color I got was a pretty blue that looks good in our kitchen. I love that it's oven safe up to 480° F which is I imagine is perfect for virtually every recipe of no-knead bread recipe out there. Besides this, there were dutch ovens that were up to 500°, but I don't remember any of them having all the other desired features besides high temperature at it's price point! Move over LeCreuset! From what I've seen, this trumps all the other enameled dutch ovens at or below it's price range whether it be The Lodge, Tramortina (Cheaper, had a whopping 6.5 quart capacity, and a color similar to mine, but had a measly 450° Oven Safe Temp and small handles!), Amazon Basics (Oven safe to only 400°, are you for real?!), or Uno Casa. The only other oven that I remember that seemed to compete with it was the Puricon, which was oven safe up to a whopping 540°! However, it was only 5 1/2 quarts compared to my 6 quart Best Choice! In the end I preferred 1/2 quart more of capacity than the super high temperature (What recipe is there out there that requires such a high heat tolerance?!)! We've already used it to cook mexican pork cooked with tomato and onion as well as potatos and turned out amazing! This will become our little kitchen workhorse that will last us for years, probably decades to come (I can just feel it!)! I wouldn't be surprised if it gets passed down through the family generation after generation! Move over LeCreuset and don't get too cocky! There's a new kid in town and his name is Best Choice! He brings quality and dependance at a much lower price!",

It won't grow your hair back but it will stop hair from falling. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it dries out the scalp and can cause dandruff due to the alcohol in the formulation. This is a small con in exchange for the ease of use of the liquid version though. If you want to avoid the dandruff and don't care much about taking a little longer when applying, the mousse version also works just as well.",

The foam melts almost immediately, making it hard to properly apply, leading to a lot of waste. Now, since it is cheaper, it probably is on par with the brand name for overall cost, which lasts longer. But if I am going to use a generic brand, and it ends up costing the same and is more difficult to use, I may as well pay more for the brand name which lasts longer.

This says on the box that this is minoxidil for men, and if you read the Instruction paper inside the box it'll say that you should not use this if you are a woman. That is complete crap. I have confirmed with my dermatologist that minoxidil 5% for men is the exact same 5% for women. It's a marketing scheme to get women to purchase minoxidil for women, but it's at a more expensive price. If you are a woman considering using minoxidil, you are completely allowed to use minoxidil for men. It's the exact same thing as minoxidil for women. Don't get scared off because of that.

This brand is much cheaper which is great because I use it all along my hairline all the way around so a 3 month supply only lasts me a month. *minoxidil is toxic to pets and I was very upset that I was not told this initially.

My hair loss got worse as the years progressed, to the point of being ready for a wig. My last ditch effort was to wait until I was done having kids (for safety's sake), and start on minoxidil. My internet research told me many women have more success with 5%, so I used it twice a day. Like others, I went through the shedding process. Since my hairloss was already so progressed, it made things even worse for about 3 months, at which point subtle regrowth began. This is a slow and steady progress, and I felt comfortable enough stop using Dermatch concealer (which I've used for over 10 years) after 10 months of use. I do occasionally use it only once a day, and haven't noticed any difference in the results. The good: It did regrow enough to my satisfaction, although it is still evident I have some level of hair loss. The bad: you have to use it for the rest of your life, and the shedding period is very frustrating. I am glad I did it, and plan to continue to use it. And the bottles say they should last about a month, but if you have typical woman hair loss like me, it needs to be spread over the majority of your head. A bottle lasts me about 2 1/2 weeks.",

Now I'm a little over three months in and after a disheartening shed process my hair is noticeably thicker and my hairline is almost back to where it was when I was 21. I honestly didn't expect the results but after I stopped shedding it was a matter of two or three weeks when I saw a dramatic, seemingly sudden, change in my hair. I've read people combining products with this but I've just used this by itself to achieve great results this quick. For the price, it's definitely worth a shot if your considering giving it a go. I've been pretty consistent for the past few months but I have missed a few applications. I read not to stress too much about missing an application but to do your best and to wait at least 6 hours after you apply the first one. Good luck hope you get the results you want.",

The results that I did see with the drops however was patchy and uneven, I don't know if I was getting all the areas or what exactly it was. I'd been looking at the foam for a while and wondered if it was worth the extra $10. The answer is YES. I got a 3 month box of the foam a little over a month ago, and I am 100% most definitely seeing certain results, such as growth overall plus new growth in the patchy areas. It's a lot more even looking now. You know the camera that is aimed at the top/back of your head in the Walmart self checkout machine?

This first mattress I purchased was the brick (the firmest you can get) a few years ago and ended up putting the cooling foam topper and cloud quilted topper on it, also from Walmart/Allswell. The firmness level was perfect for my back but needed a little extra cushioning for my knees. This combination made my dream bed 🛌 😴. Still use this to this day!!! My most recent purchase was the supreme mattress, and it has a cooling attached topper, which is a must for Arizona 🌵🔥!!! This is in a guest room and the comfort level is perfect!!! I am so happy with the affordability and comfort of both purchases and will be back for sure, this is my go to mattress place now. Thank you Allswell 😊",

My skepticism was heightened when I found out that they were going to send this to me in a box, rolled up. I have bought other mattresses (e.g. Ikea) in a rolled up form and was not terribly impressed though it worked. My experience with the Allswell Supreme has truly changed my opinions and settled all of my skepticism. The package is heavy. There was no white glove delivery option due to COVID19. The shipping company (FedEx) driver was very careless and rough, destroyed the box. I complained to them for the treatment of the package. Thankfully the mattress itself was undamaged and was wrapped well inside. Getting it up the stairs was quite a feat, it is heavy and awkward. Once it was laid out on our box springs, it was extremely easy. Open up the package and let it air out for 48 hours and it was amazing! The mattress is very comfortable and hugs you a minute after you lay down. It is not an uncomfortable hug but just enough, the springs do not allow for a full sink in, it is perfect. The bed does not get hot at night. The sheets do have to be deep pocket sheets, the mattress is 14 inches. I woke up the next morning for the first time in years without pain in my shoulders and hips (side-sleeper). My fitbit recordings of my sleep have been excellent. My wife and I are so thankful we bought this mattress. It was incredibly reasonable with the Pre-Christmas sale that was running. Value price, Incredible quality, excellent product. I would recommend this to anyone. This mattress may have put my physical therapist and chiropractor out of business.",

Unboxed on top of our box spring, and unrolled plastic wrap forever. Cut the plastic wrap covering the bed itself, and in (2) hours my wife was taking her noontime nappy. Now this is someone who many years ago could smell a dirty diaper from three rooms away. So that is evidence that we experienced little to no off airing of the mattress. Living in FL we did have the luxury of opening our bedroom windows to air out any unpleasant odor. Our first night sleeping on this bed was just wonderful. If you have any reservations about purchasing this bed, forget about it, and order now. Our bed did not come with handles; however, when unboxing on the box springs they are not necessary. Goodnight as Allswell.",

As you can imagine, I was really disappointed because I knew being a Friday, there was no way this would get resolved until Monday. We ended up sleeping on the mattress through the weekend and loved how comfortable it was! With a mattress covering and sheets, we weren't as bothered by the melted plastic. I sent an email to customer service, but never heard back, so I called Tuesday morning. Was never put on hold, was answered by the sweetest representative right away. She was able to pull up the pictures that I sent in my email and assured me this has never happened in the past. She placed a new order and we received another Supreme mattress that Friday. This time no melted plastic! It's been about a month now, and my husband and I LOVE our new mattress. Not sure how this will last for years to come, but right now, we are very happy with our purchase and the Allswell customer service. For reference, I'm 118lb side sleeper, and my husband is 170lbs sleeps on side and back. I also sleep very hot (we live in FL) and this mattress is much cooler than our previous memory foam mattress.",

          "review_text": "Don't let my 4 star rating (instead of a 5) mislead you. The Supreme Cal King mattress is an awesome product as well as an incredible value. This was my first experience with an on-line mattress and a \"Bed-in-a-Box\". My wife and I had no idea what to expect. The box came in severely damaged and we assumed the mattress would be damaged as well. The abundant wrapping and bagging protected the mattress from suffering any damage from the freight company mishandling. Because of the Covid-19 restrictions, the white glove option wasn't available. This means we had to remove our 20 year old traditional mattress and replace it with the new one ourselves. This was easier than I thought, but not for the feint of heart. The 'trick' is to place the bagged, compressed mattress in place and open an entire end of the mattress bag. the mattress will decompress and you can incrementally work the bag off of the mattress. Sadly, we didn't have the mattress oriented properly, so we had to turn the mattress. This wasn't excessively difficult. It's difficult to to select a mattress on-line. We need a firmer mattress so we thought a medium to firm rating would suffice. Sadly, this wasn't the case. Keep in mind, the firmness ratings differ from retailer to retailer. A firm rating at one site seems to be a medium at another. Another consideration is a hybrid mattress (springs and foam) is quite different from an older traditional mattress. The foam takes some getting used to. To my dismay, this isn't something I could adjust to, even after more than two weeks on the mattress. I'm a tall person with back and knee issues. The foam supported my entire body, but didn't offer the overall alignment I need to prevent back pain. Perhaps one of the other mattresses could, but as an old dog that's not ready for new tricks, I think I'm going to stick with a more traditional mattress. I still think the quality of the mattress is surprisingly good, and the value is spectacular. If you are of normal height and weight, this could be the mattress for you.",

The memory foam on top only kicks in a while after you've sat on it, but it's barely any give. The height is perfect and the material is nice but I just can't work with how firm it is. Even when you punch the bed, it is SUPER hard. After the first night I woke up completely sore but I thought it was from moving into my new apartment. But now, it has been a full week and I am buying a memory foam mattress topper because 1) I don't want to go through the hassle of returning this and 2) I don't want to have to research and wait to get a different one.

I can smooth it out in the morning and it doesn't seem to interfere with my sleep, but I'm not pleased that it does this. Also I bought sheets to fit a 14 inch mattress, but they are loose. Not sure it the mattress really is 14 inches. I like the bottom fitted sheet to be snug but it is “loose” when I put it on. Mattress felt more “firm” initially and I think is getting softer the more we sleep on it. Is this possible after a few weeks? That is fine with me as I wanted something a less firm and with a soft top feel. Overall, I would not return it, but wanted to give this feedback, since you asked!",

I'm 27 and a nurse and mom to a young toddler, my back was aching every day with my 8 year old traditional spring+pillow top mattress. I was doing most everything in my power to feel better, but nothing was helping... for months! I decided it was time for a mattress upgrade. From night 1 I noticed a difference. A few weeks later and I just noticed- no more ibuprofen, and heating pads every evening... I feel great! The only thing I can attribute it to is this new mattress. I'm still working just as hard and playing just as hard with my baby, but my back feels great! Some added bonuses I wasn't looking for but am loving: very minimal motion transfer- I can't even tell with my partner gets up, or even moves in the bed unless he's directly touching me. Also I had been warned about the smells with bed in the box, and I hardly even noticed any off-gasing smells at all. Maybe the first night, if you shoved your face into the bed, you could smell a slight chemically smell. But it wasn't bad or overpowering, kinda like a sharpie smell? Definitely didn't take long to disappear. Overall, would definitely recommend!",

Other than that one minor item - the bed is AWESOME and so much more affordable than the other beds I was considering.",

Should have received it within two weeks, but upon investigation, apparently the label was damaged and mattress was returned to Allswell. Called Customer Service, Samantha K., she was great! Got it all straightened out and another mattress sent and received within a week. The box it arrived in was notsealed well. The tape on what should have been the \"bottom\" of the box, based on the arrows, was completely unsealed - all flaps could open. Thankfully, nothing was damaged and the tape on the rest of the box held. I give this only so the shipping tape, etc. can be improved upon for your future shipments. The mattress - GREAT!! My husband's word \"I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud\"; it is really comfortable and especially since we both sleep on our sides alot. We're \"technically\" seniors (don't \"think\" as a senior), so every once in a while these joints can get \"tricky\" in the shoulders and lower back - no problems so far - love it!",

As for the comfort level, it's definitely good so far. nice and firm when laying down but with a little cushion on the top. it's too soft for our preference at this time, but we were previously on a firm foam mattress so it's an adjustment that will need more time to see if its the best fit.

I have constant back pain due to an injury. I've been falling asleep faster and sleeping all night most nights compared to waking several times per night trying to get comfortable with my old mattress.

We have a 5 yr old. He is my test study. Used it for about an hour or so and our 5 yr old was eying me to use it. First 5 minutes its on the floor being trampled by our 80 pd dog. About an hour later its outside and had fallen off the steps. Water still cold, straw still working and no leaks. This is my favorite tumbler by far. Its strong enough for our 5 yr old son and our 80 pd dog, and its 2 days later. I expect this tumbler to last a long time and keep my drink cold ! The reusable straw is one of the strongest also.",

I like all the different lid options for it, but I don't like that it did not come with a case or bag to carry to storage the different lids when you're not using them. I also did not like that I had to read the directions to learn how to open the mug lid or the even after reading the directions I do not know if the mug is dishwasher safe or not. So to be on the safe side I have just been hand washing it. I would not recommend only because it does not give you a travel case for the lid options, because I do like that all the lid options seal properly and it does not spill.",

          "review_text": "It was a little confusing to figure that it was a screw top as my other Ozark are gasket seal top and the directions were hidden inside the sealed top. Also not sure about the bottle top as its to small for a beer unless you pour the beer inside prior to putting the bottle top on and even then its not really full. Overall I love Ozark and like the texture of this one. The screw top also feels more secure and great for activities and keeping bugs out. Ozark also keeps my drinks cold for a good long period of time.",

I love the fact that it comes with a slim lid w/straw, a lid for hot liquids, and my favorite is the accessory/lid that turns the tumbler into a bottle, it actually extends the tumbler with a plastic piece shaped like the top of a bottle and then has a stainless lid that goes onto that. I use the tumbler in bottle form most often, I even fill it up with ice water every night and keep it beside my bed in case I need a drink in the middle of the night. In the morning I still have ice in the tumbler. I really like everything about this product, it looks good, it is very functional, the accessories allow it to be used in different and unique ways, etc. Overall, I am very happy with this tumbler set from Ozark Trail.",

My daughter loves the option of the tumbler because she brings cold water to school, it was easy for her to add the ice and then screw the lid to add water. I like that it's leakproof and shatterproof, perfect for my daughter to bring it to school. This is a great option for everyone because all you need is just one cup that does it all!

I may not have everything she said in her directions but for the most part....first put them in a cool dryer for four or five cycles to get rid of most of the fluff. Then wash with (I used cold water) half cup vinegar. Then dry as normal. They came out wonderful. Soft fluffy and absorbent. And I did the before and after test as shown by the manufacturer. They did actually almost doubled in size after that one wash. Oh, I did not mention, do not use fabric softener. Enjoy!",

The only issue I had was the shipment packaging was poor. Most were items were not in a plastic wrap. The bath sheets and washcloths were just thrown into a box. The box was poorly taped on top and bottom and was partially opened. It was bad enough that the delivery person recommended I check to see if all my items were there. I don't know at what point in the packaging or shipping process it occurred but at least the items were all there with original tags.",

I took it home, washed it first (didn't find any lint balls like some people said although it did shed a lot in the dryer on medium heat) and then I took a shower. That's when I knew it wasn't for me. It smeared the water around instead of absorbed it. Just like all the rest. I have old towels from the 70's and 80's that when you use them the water is GONE when you wipe. They ABSORB moisture. This one didn't do that. This was a bath sheet for goodness sake and I still had to use a separate towel to completely dry off (yes I'm a large person but still...) Would not recommend this at all.",

The towels feel more plush on each side which sounds like it would be great but it is not at all. While cozy, they’re so plush that they don’t seem to wick moisture away as easily as their predecessors. I don’t want to be in bed with my towel blanketing me so coziness only goes so far. I like the previous bath sheet that had differing terry construction on each side. One was more flat - though looped and terry - and the other side a bit more cozy but not to the level of the newest version. The color didn’t meet the image advertised. I was expecting what one may call a muted teal. I rec’d something closer to a medium blue with a tinge of teal. Perhaps that sounds the same. To the eye, it just isn’t except to the eyes of my spouse who is color-blind. It is not a horrible color - it’s nice - just doesn’t meet the advertised image. I hope BHG returns to their previous construction. I love my bath sheets most when they make it easy to dry my body. Who knew that would be the expectation? lol",

I can't tell you the problem I had trying to find the perfect bra. I purchased several and always ended up taking them back. When I found these bras, I am stocking up on. I can tell you that.

They fluffed up very nicely and they are not too thick nor too thin in my opinion. I think they are absolutely beautiful and they look expensive at a cheaper price than most places! They look amazing in my linen closet and have a salon/spa vibe to them! If you just got married or moved to a new place and you need quality and affordable towels that look and work great, I would 100% recommend these!!!",

Which is fine but they weren’t the color I wanted. I decided to keep them anyway and when I washed them and I did follow the washing instructions, I pulled out a huge coat of lint from them. I was really shocked by that. I wondered what was left of the towels? They were fine and still fluffy/full. I have posted 2 pictures showing the color difference and the horrible amount of lint I pulled out from the dryer. Only time will tell if these last long.",

We plan to buy some for us! I washed them on the gentle cycle and dry them in the dryer so they're fluffy and not stiff and they do give off a good amount of lint in the dryer and some on my daughter's body when drying but its okay, it comes off later on as the day goes by and shes dry.

I like to rotate my towels every few years or as needed. The description sounded promising and offering good quality. However, I was very surprised how soft these were, right out of the box. The description mentioned how “extremely soft and fluffy” they were, and they truly are. I have washed them 2 times using laundry soap and bleach and they remained just as soft and fluffy. I hate to say it, but I can defiantly feel the difference between these new towels and my older towels. They are also thick and very absorbent. I use the Hand Towle for the guest bathroom and my guest even commented on how soft the hand towel was. I have always purchased white towels because of the ability to always use bleach to wash them, but sometime the bleach tends to add roughness to the texture of my towels, but I can pleasantly say that these towels continue to be very soft. I plan to purchase more of these towels as I change out and rotate my towels. I highly recommend these towels.",

          "review_text": "Overall, I am fairly happy with the Better Homes and Gardens bath towel. It is a Signature Soft bath towel that is made with cotton that is sustainably grown in the USA. It is very soft and fluffy and has a nice thickness to it. However, the only thing I wasn't happy with is that I don't find it to be as absorbent as I personally like a towel to be, and even after a few washes, it didn't seem to get more absorbent. I think for most people, it will work just fine and it has some great features that will appeal to others. It is fade resistant and has low lint. It has an Intellifresh freshness protection that keeps it smelling fresh over time. It has PureLOFT technology that makes the towel loftier after the first few laundry cycles in the washer and dryer. It's a pretty standard sized bath towel at 30 inches by 56 inches. I love the silver color and it looks great with a lot of décor. I like the simple stitching design pattern because it's just enough to give it a little bit of interest, but doesn't seem overpowering to be able to pair with other towels or décor. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a unique towel with some features, that is a simple design to match most décor!",

I love a good bargain in most cases but I am very particular about the towels I buy because I want them to be soft, absorbent, and last for a very long time. I usually get pretty pricey ones from a department store so I have to be honest that I just wasn't expecting this towel to be as nice as it seems so far. It was completely unabsorbent and frustrating after the first two washes but starting after the third wash it has an incredible texture and so far, after five washes, I haven't seen any loose threads or pulling/misshapen areas. The color is very pretty, sort of a slate grey blue, and the waffle texture looks pretty hanging in the bathroom. I wash my towels with all natural odor removing detergent after every second shower so I haven't really noticed or had this one long enough to know if the \"Intellifresh TM Freshness Protection\" really does anything to help but I do like the idea of it. It's also very important to me that it's made with USA grown cotton. If it was organic cotton it would absolutely be a five star towel. I really prefer organic cotton so I'm on the fence about whether I'll buy more or not but I would absolutely recommend them to anyone who isn't quite as concerned about that.",

My 6 and 10yr olds were impressed when I unboxed these and wanted to snuggle them like blankets. They have been used, washed and dried many times in less than 2 weeks time. Each time they come out of the dryer someone grabs it (instead of the bathroom Set) for their showers. They are beautiful and just amazingly soft! I definitely plan to get more of these to have on hand so I don’t have to keep sharing mine haha ;)",

I am recovering from a foot injury, so walking through a parking lot and big box store is challenging for me. I'd seen these at a friend's house and liked them, so I ordered four bath towels online. I received three bath towels and one bath sheet in error, so I started the exchange process online. One of the return options was to send the towel back through a FedEx Office location. I checked, and there were several including one in my town, so I chose that option (again, trying to avoid going to the next town and dealing with the Walmart parking lot and store). The next screen only gave me limited FedEx Office locations, the closest being in that Walmart I was trying to avoid. At that point, I couldn't go back and change my return option. So, I brought the bath sheet to my Walmart on the next Saturday, only to discover that the FedEx Office in the Walmart is only open limited hours on weekdays, meaning I will have to do all of that again on Monday and rush to make the hours after work. If I had a lot of free time and if I weren't recovering, this would STILL be an annoying inconvenience. Next time, I will use Amazon.",

The bath towel is a generous size and dries pretty quickly. I love the pattern as well. The detail in the stripes and the trim along the bottom are a nice touch. The hand towel is being used in our powder room/guest bathroom because it looks so nice! These look and feel well-made and would definitely make a great engagement, bridal, or housewarming gift.",

Once you pick it up you can feel that it's soft, And a nice thickness. Once you feel it wrapped around you, I noticed you dry off much quicker. The strip ripping in the BATH towel pattern, makes it look fresh and modern looking. Once you wash, it looks brand new again. It's so nice to have a HAND towel to match the bath towel for show, and to just grab to use for Hand washing for fast drying. You might want to get more than one set, because you will fall in love with it, once you use it!",

The trim and stripes are very pale blue; not white. Bath size towel is 30\"W x 54\"L. They are made of 100% soft cotton, in China. The quality of these towels is excellent.",

The huge bath towel also very well made & very soft to the touch. I was able to dry off after my shower with no issues. The color scheme is perfect for my home & my sons are envious i got this to check out. Cant wait to find this in the store and buy more towels for my home.. I highly recommend for you to purchase.",

Effectiveness: It keeps my car so much cooler, even on the hottest days. I can literally feel the temperature difference the moment I open the door — no more burning seats or steering wheels! Versatility: It fits perfectly in both my SUV and my sedan, thanks to its smart, universal design. Super easy to adjust if needed! Durability: The material feels tough and built to last. I’ve been using it daily, folding and unfolding, and it still looks brand new — no tears, no creases. Design: Sleek and practical! I love the accordion fold — it’s quick to open and just as easy to collapse and store. Plus, it doesn’t take up much space when not in use. Installation: Couldn’t be easier — just open it and pop it behind the windshield. Takes literally two seconds, and it stays in place perfectly.",

And the phone only comes with the charging cable, not the outlet cube, so this was literally perfect timing as I have no other usb-c chargers. I was initially surprised at how small the charger is (see picture with hand for size reference), but it is small but mighty! I love the compact design, as I can take this charger with me anywhere. I throw it in my work bag, bring it in my car and have even used it in the small space between the outlet and our sofa. I love that the portion that plugs into the wall can be folded up back into the charger, helping its compact size. My usb-c charging cable works perfectly with this, and my phone charges very fast. I've really found great use and have been loving this compact usb-c charger! Overall I definitely recommend, especially if you're on the go and need a charger that you can bring with you anywhere!",

The additional 12W USB-A port is handy for charging a second device simultaneously, though at a slower rate. One aspect I appreciate is its compact design, making it easy to carry around. However, I noticed that it doesn't have folding prongs, which would have been a nice feature for travel.

It adds a fun pop to my desk and travel bag, plus my teenage boys & husband won't touch it because it's pink. More importantly, it charges my devices really fast. The USB-C port powers up my phone in no time, and I can charge my earbuds at the same time using the regular USB port. I highly recommend!",

          "review_text": "I am quickly becoming a huge fan of Onn products and this travel charger is one of the reasons why. I love that it has the two different ports and I also love that the plug folds down for ease of packing. It's well made and very sturdy. I am very impressed with the \"fast charge\" and feel that is accurate. The only thing, and it could be just me misunderstanding the wording on the package, is the LED lighting. I tried it in different lighting and didn't see an LED light anywhere. That said, I don't care at all about that (I don't need a nightlight in my hotel room), so I'm not going to reduce my overall rating for that. It could easily be a fault in this unit that doesn't have any bearing on how it functions and honestly, I'm happier without the light. It has been a great charger and it is currently in my travel bag awaiting a trip this weekend!",

The power bank feels solid and well-built, and I love the soft pink color—it looks sleek and modern. The dual USB ports are super convenient for charging both my phone and tablet at the same time. Overall, this is a solid and stylish power bank for the price, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for something dependable and travel-friendly!",

I got more long term succes if my cell phone is already at 100% and I plug the power bank the whole day so phone battery never drains. In this case current drawn is 0.5A. If I let the cell phone deplete close to zero and plug the power bank to both charge and continue to use the phone, then I might get 1.5 charge during one day. In this case current drawn is 1.8A. Also performance decrese below 12oC (55F) and charge time increase. Below 0oC (32F) it's useless for high drain applications. It might still be usefull for load below 0.5A.",

It works fine for the most part — it charges my phone about 1.5 times on a full charge, which is decent but not amazing for the size. It's not the fastest when it comes to recharging itself either, so you have to plan ahead. The build quality is alright — feels a bit plasticky but hasn't given me any trouble so far. The size is pocket-friendly, which I like, and it's light enough to carry around in my bag. Overall, it's an okay backup option, but I wouldn't rely on it for heavy use or long trips. If you just need something basic for emergencies, this does the trick. --- If you'd like, I can tailor it to a specific model or your actual experience — just let me know!",

After testing it out of the box to see if it could charge my phone, I decided to plug the battery back to charge up it to see if it would charge above 60%. It does! It is now at 80% charged and charging to 100%. Took maybe a couple of hours. So far this is looking like a solid portable power bank.

They said take it back like this was a book or something smh…I will NEVER buy anything from GTRacing again, their customer service sucks and their design sucks!

Wheels are way better than my last gaming chair. Took 20-30 minutes to put together. Not difficult, but a handful of bolts to be hand tightened with the included tools. Glad I got the new chair. Probably won't last for more than a few years, but for the money I spent, that's acceptable.",

It was fairly easy to assemble and seems pretty sturdy. Came with extra parts, which weren't needed, but handy to have. Just wish it had come with an extra caster, but they seem to be standard ones, so easily replaced if needed. Over all, a pretty good buy. Recommended, especially for the price.",

          "review_text": "Generally speaking, the quality of the chair is “good for the meantime”. It is a comfortable chair and rolls really nicely. The chair functions overall, as intended. The main issues I have with the chair are the arms of the chair and the foot rest. The overall design of the foot rest makes pulling out the foot rest easy but, extremely difficult to put back. You have to wiggle pretty aggressively to return it back out of the way. Furthermore the arm rests come with covers that cover the nails to tighten the arms, makes the design look sleek, however dot com, it makes it more challenging to tighten the arms as frequently as it needs. That all being said, my cats enjoy stealing it from me and it was comfortable for the meantime but I had to replace it already with something a little better and actually cheaper!",

Amazon, Best Buy had nothing that could be shipped to me in a short amount of time. So, I checked Walmart, and they had the GTRACING GTWD-200 gaming chair in-stock and could pick it up that day. The chair costs approximately $125.00 including tax; excellent value. It took approximately 30 to 35 minutes to assemble, and it comes with the tool to assemble the chair, so no extra tools needed. It is very comfortable and is great for big guys. The chair has plenty of room to sit comfortably and has multiple adjustments to reach your comfort zone. Overall, great value for the money and I recommend.",

The bolt came loose and when unzipped the cover my husband discovered the weld broke. He was able to sort of fix by drilling a hole in the metal piece and put an additional bolt to anchor. The look of the chair is nice and the features offered are good but another issue is the reclining feature doesn't seem “stable”. What I mean is that if you even slightly lean back the chair will keep reclining. Just beware.",

It tore into my hips and legs, hurt my back and bum, no lumbar support and extremely hard on the sides and tooo firm overall. Since I put the box out for recycling, I cannot return it. Now I am stuck with it and loss of money. So it just sits in the back room, which I will probably just give it away to someone's less fortunate child to make his or her day.

          "review_text": "Pros: It's a great chair, comfortable, and supportive. It raises higher than other chairs I've had and stays lifted. I don't slide off when reclining. It looks nice and fits well behind my desk. Cons: The arms aren't adjustable and not in the best place for my body size, but they're not terrible. The paddles for adjusting the recline is a bit out of reach, so I keep grabbing the one that lowers me down instead. Wish it was a bit closer to the front. Attaching the lumbar and head pillows was a bit of a pain and don't adjust as well as I'd like. The straps are cheaply made so it'll probably snap off eventually. I had to use another pillow for lumbar as the one it came with isn't great. Overall though I like the chair and have less back problems now compared to my old chairs.",

          "review_text": "Here's a review of the gaming chair from my personal experience: I recently upgraded my gaming setup with the GTRACING gaming chair, and honestly, it's been a game-changer for me. As someone who spends hours gaming, working, or just chilling at my desk, comfort is a huge deal. This chair nails it with its adjustable pillows that perfectly support my neck and back—no more post-session aches for me! The upholstered cushion is super comfy, making those extended gaming sessions feel like a breeze. What I absolutely love is the ergonomic footrest and the reclining feature that allows me to kick back and relax in style. It's not just about comfort; this chair makes my gaming space look more modern and sleek. It's sturdy too, handling up to 290 pounds with ease, and the customizable features like seat height, headrest, and lumbar pillow adjustments are top-notch. I can tweak everything to fit just right, which is a big plus. Overall, investing in this chair was a smart move. It's enhanced my gaming experience significantly and also doubled up as a comfy spot for work. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their seating!",

However, the quality of the material is not what I expected. The leather looks cheap, and I dont think it is durable. The color of the black leather is different for each part, which also makes it look cheap. The wheels don't feel safe; it gets off from adjusting myself to the table. It is not securely attached. The footrest also doesn't feel safe. like if I put in a little weight, it might actually cause me to lose balance, which will also push wheels out.

          "review_text": "After reading tons and tons of reviews I finally settled on this one for my 15 year old 6'2\" son who has a habit of leaning back in chairs and just went through a (bad) brand new one he got for Christmas from Walmart with super cruddy support bars in the lower back area that were not even properly welded. Literally just tack welded. Needless to say, that 4 month old chair is garbage now. Very flimsy and not well built. I set out on a search for a better built chair with better back support bracing and more comfortable. He spends alot of time in his chair for homeschooling and also gaming so I decided on this one and it has a very wide support bracing in the back area where teens have a habit of leaning back in the chair. Much better. I was pleased to see this. This chair is very comfortable and the back comes up nice and high and I love how the sides feel like they sort of wrap around your body and offer support. It's good and roomy and the wheels are nice and smooth and it came with a support pillow for your neck and low back. He put it together himself in about 20 minutes. Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this chair again. Infact, I am about to purchase a second chair for my daughter who is also homeschooling and spends alot of time in a chair and needs a good comfortable chair and this is a great choice. I am big on reading reviews and found them extremely helpful for me when I was searching for this one so I hope this review helps someone else who is in search for a great chair.",

          "review_text": "I really, really wanted to love this chair, but I don't and can't! This chair is beautiful, but it is sooo uncomfortable! The gray fabric is rough - really, truly rough. Nothing soft about it at all! I read all the reviews before I bought it and figured those who said it's rough were just being nitpicky. They were not! It's rough and uncomfortable to the point that I can only sit on it if I have a blanket over it. And it is*not* the perfect chair for a reading nook! The back is way too short to settle in and get comfy to read. I have to slouch way down and pile up the pillows just right behind my head for support, and it's still not comfortable. I can, however, see that this would be a great chair (or chairs, if you need multiples) for a sitting/conversation area where everyone will be sitting upright and, presumably, fully dressed. It has a maximum load weight of 225 lbs, so many big and/or tall people will exceed the weight limit. Something to consider if you're purchasing it to have company over. The instructions say you must have two or more people to assemble it, but I have janky shoulders and was able to assemble it by myself, so two people aren't absolutely necessary. I don't necessarily not recommend it, but I only recommend it for certain situations. This is not the chair for snuggling in for a cold, rainy day of reading and relaxing.",

          "review_text": "This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a product review. I'd like to first say that my wife and I really wanted to like these chairs (we bought two). The chairs are attractive and are reasonably priced. At first, we also found them relatively cozy. However, as time has gone on we have come to the conclusion that these are the most uncomfortable chairs we have ever owned. The seat bottom is extremely hard. We thought the bottoms might soften somewhat over time, but they have not. My wife has taken to sitting on a pillow when using the chair. In addition, the back being composed of three separate pillows seems like a good idea, but in practice it's a pain (literally). Every shift in position requires moving the pillows and it's difficult to find a consistently comfortable position. The back/pillows are also relatively low, meaning there is inadequate back support. Finally, the seat height is low. If you use the chair with an ottoman, your feet tend to be higher than your backside, resulting in an awkward sitting position. We have given up trying to make due with these chairs and are currently looking for new ones.",

I ordered two of them immediately. They shipped quickly, and I got them within a few days. Set up was great, no issues. The size, look and comfort are exceptional. I was a little iffy about getting a corduroy chair, but it looks really cool and the fabric is very soft.. I wanted a chair that my husband would be comfortable in, and this one is perfect. As other reviewers had noted, there is a pink or mauve undertone in the FAWN color. But it is definitely more tan or beige than pink and, depending on lighting, you don’t see the pink at all. These chairs are perfect to watch the sunrise from our bedroom window and swivel around to watch the morning news. Super practical and literally beautiful.",

I want to note the corded look is nice! I just don’t find it working for my space. Overall assembly was easy and again the couch itself is soft and comfortable, but the color didn’t meet expectations which is why I didn’t give it full stars.

I tried calling her back, but the number could not be reached. back and forth with CS from walmart and CS fedex, no chair, but we are sorry for your inconvenience. It was stated over and over, day after day, until I realized no chair would be coming. Fedex failed walmart, and walmart failed me. I'm sure the chair would have been beautiful, and the price was excellent for those lucky enough to receive it. now, if walmart shipped with ups, I would be sitting in my chair and enjoying it. UPS delivers in my neck of the woods. Fedex allows its drivers to decide where and if a delivery is fit to be moved. I'm old enough to remember when K-mart was king and wal-mart was an infant. you are king now walmart how much longer will you rein. I'm going to take a look at some other discount stores... who!! like you were, once upon a time, an infant just trying to grow. a small store trying to survive and had the best of everything customer oriented, so thanks for your service of yesteryear.",

          "review_text": "This is completely unacceptable. I live in a NYC high rise with a doorman and exceptional package acceptance service, which logs every single delivery into the building. They have ZERO record of this being delivered. It’s also interesting that upon dispute of this, Federal Express actually went into their system and changed important details of the delivery, including the actual delivery date. They clearly are in error and at fault. I wonder why this isn’t being taken up with your actual delivery service Federal Express, as I see these chairs being offered all over Facebook Marketplace in my area, new and in box at reduced rates. You have to wonder if they are being stolen by actual Federal Express workers and then re-sold. I should not and will not dispute this with my bank. Your staff already told me on a phone call yesterday that I was being sent a new chair. So, are you now telling me Walmart is now not standing by what was already promised to me? You can refer back to that call that took place yesterday. I am sure it was recorded. I was told that a replacement would be sent between Jan 11 and Feb 11, and I would receive an email confirmation, which I have yet to receive. Would you like to speak to the package delivery service, which is provided by my building to confirm that ZERO package was delivered here. Walmart chose to deliver a $300 plus item without getting signature confirmation or even a photograph of where it was delivered. Even Amazon does that. That was NOT my choice. This fault falls on Walmart and Federal Express and I should and will receive a refund from Walmart for an item that was not received. Margo Osborne",

The construction on this chair is heavy duty, not some particle board junk. Each chair comes in one box and the box is pretty heavy. The delivery was to my front sidewalk! I opened the boxes outside and brought in the pieces one by one which worked fine. Assembly was pretty straightforward and the instructions were very simple and the hardware was packaged well. I assembled them by myself and it took about 20 minutes for the first one and a little shorter on the second. No problems with damaged boxes and the packaging was great! Delivery time was very fast, with my order being placed late on December 1 and delivery on December 5! As other reviewers have pointed out, comparable chairs at other retailers are double what this chair sells for. If you are looking for this type of style chair, I highly recommend purchasing this one. Great job, Drew!",

Do I get anything for this trouble - No! Amazing.

Wouldn’t have ordered if I knew it was going to go to free shipping. Can’t return to get shipping cost back. Customer service rep I talked to was nice but they couldn’t help me since Walmart wouldn’t let them lol. Love the chair, not so much Walmart.

          "review_text": "These things shipped quickly and arrived just in time for Thanksgiving. The last time I purchased a metal chair like this was from Lowes' about 10 years ago for around $9. Considering that was a decade ago, these are not bad at all for $11.25 each delivered free to my house with Walmart . The thing I love about Walmart compared to Amazon is that they know how to charge the correct tax rate. Some large online retailers charge a negotiated tax rate for each state. For example, Alabama's is 8%. That's cheaper that some cities rate in Alabama. I don't live in a city though. My tax rate should only be 5%. I love that Walmart puts forth the effort to get it right and get the money to the correct places. I know that has nothing to do with the chairs, I just wanted to point that our. Buy stuff from Walmart when you can instead of Amazon. Back to the chairs, they are decent quality and sturdy. I'm 6'2\" and weigh about 260lbs and I feel very secure sitting in these chairs, unlike some of the plastic folding chairs that I'm afraid I will break.",

They're steel and very well made. They have weight to them but are not overly heavy. The polished finish is very nice and smooth. The seat may be too small for a hefty adult especially if they need more depth but otherwise should do the job. I am 5\"10 and the chair makes me sit up pretty straight. I am especially pleased with them for what I need them to do. Entertain and put them away. Delivery went well all things considered too. They were very fairly priced too. Provided they hold up, I feel I got great value for my money.",

I like that I can fold it away when I dont need it to save space. I saw another review stating itwasn'tt level and this concerned me but I haven't had any issue with that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition as well. I'm very happy with this table overall.",

THE ONLY REASON I TOOK AWAY A STAR is because of the design of the legs. Im not fond of how it criss crosses and causes me to have to place my feet while using it.

If you need an adjustable, portable, sturdy table, this is a good choice. We also sent one to my mother while she recuperated from knee replacement surgery.

The 'ironing board' legs make it very accessible to wheelchairs etc., as well as the adjustable height positioning. It seems very durable, not likely to break. Neutral in color & easy to clean. However those with limited hand strength may have a problem with the 'squeeze trigger' mechanism for height adjustment. Confined to a chair, I had to fumble with it a bit before getting it set. But its fairly lightweight & the legs snap lock when its folded for storage. There are plastic end caps on the legs so they don't scratch the floor. After surgery & in a wheelchair I've used this in the kitchen as a prep table (when my boyfriend isn't using it for his model planes or other hobby work!)",

I have had this table for at least 10 years now. I often work on construction sites programming various systems. This table gives me plenty of room for my laptop, mouse, papers and coffee! The table is very sturdy and has taken a lot of abuse over the years. In fact I am using it right now for my laptop. If you need a portable workspace that does not take up much room this is the table for you. Many of my coworkers have purchased tables similar but they either complain about them or have had them break after a few years. Great product!",

Drain holes are easily punched out due to placement in bottom of planter. Don't forget to get the wheeled bases sold separately because when filled, they are heavy.",

          "review_text": "I have removed one star because they folks at Clorox decided to \"improve\" something that was working fine, and now it doesn't work well at all. The old nozzle always had a small round opening through which the product dispensed. The harder you squeezed the bottle, the farther the product launched so it was easy to get it up under the rim during the application. The new nozzle has a longer, slit-style opening for \"wider application\". In theory, this sounds like it could be a good idea. The reality is that this opening is simply too large to get the product to project from the bottle- regardless how hard I squeeze. It just globs out and falls straight down. Didn't anyone test this idea prior to putting it into production?? I ended up having to manually spread the cleaning gel around inside the bowl with my brush. This means having to clean the brush after each application, apply to the next toilet, wash the brush, apply to the next toilet... After they all have cleaner in them, then I go back where I started and scrub each of the bowls and rinsing the brush AGAIN before moving on to the next. When this is gone, I will not buy again unless I find it is bottled with the old cap. It's a shame too because I actually prefer the product inside over the competition's.",

We got a size 4T and it is perfect. I prefer brand new clothing to be just a slight bit on the bigger side just so he has room to grow and more time to wear it. I honestly think this was perfect. A 4T is his true size and it did run just a little bigger but I believe the makers may have had the same thing in mind because it isn't so big that he can't wear it right away. The material is top notch and the jacket overall is a really great quality. The embroidered patches all over make this jacket really pop. The price is too good to be true in my opinion so to me this one is a no brainer.",
