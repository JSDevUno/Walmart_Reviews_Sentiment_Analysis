      "review_text": "I purchased the Mainstays 26\" Adjustable Height Personal Folding Table for use in my home office, and I couldn't be happier with it! The table is the perfect size for tight spaces, providing just enough surface area without taking up too much room. The adjustable height feature is a game changer – I can easily switch between sitting and standing positions, making it great for both work and leisure. The table is lightweight yet sturdy, and the folding mechanism makes it super convenient to store when not in use. I love the sleek black finish, which complements my décor nicely. It was easy to set up right out of the box, and I've used it for everything from paperwork to crafting. It's durable enough for daily use and can handle a variety of tasks. Overall, a fantastic value for the price, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a compact, adjustable, and multi-purpose table!",

I like that I can fold it away when I dont need it to save space. I saw another review stating itwasn'tt level and this concerned me but I haven't had any issue with that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition as well. I'm very happy with this table overall.",
