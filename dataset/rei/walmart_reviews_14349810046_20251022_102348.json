I hooked it up to my TV, and it came right up into configuration screen, answered a few questions and it was up and running. Has a screen where you take a picture with your phone and the app installs real easy. I've only hooked up two cameras of the four that came with it, deciding where to put the other 2. Wires are super long so easy to place where you need.",

      "review_text": "It is a wired connection system which is better for stable connection and with 65 feet of wiring, it was plenty enough to set it up where you want. I also like that the power cord is simpler as you only need one to power all the cameras and one to power the DVR so you don't have too many wires with each camera needing it's own power adapter. It's a lot simpler this way. The installation and setup is pretty simple and straightforward and with the preinstalled 1 TB hard drive you have plenty of space to store saved videos. This system comes with 4 cameras but I like that you have the option to add another 4 more if you want. It's compatible with windows, mac, android and iOS so it works with all my devices. The cameras are compact and lightweight so easy to install and fit anywhere. This is a pretty good value home security system that's easy to use and has lots of options so I recommend this to anyone looking for a home/business security system.",
