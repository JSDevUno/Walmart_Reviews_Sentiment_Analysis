I was pleasantly surprised at how truly invisible the deodorant is! I even tested it against dark clothing and it does not stain my clothes which is a huge plus! I got the tropical scent and I love how it smells and not to mention the fragrance is long lasting.",

This is the first time I've tried their deodorants so I can't personally compare it. But I won't be purchasing this product. I have a clinical strength that works all day and doesn't leave white marks on my clothes. I appreciate the opportunity to try these. Maybe if they change them, so it actually lasts for 24 hours, I would change my mind.",
