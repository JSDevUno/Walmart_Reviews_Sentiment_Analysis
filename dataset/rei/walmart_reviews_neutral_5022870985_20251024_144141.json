      "review_text": "Recently I purchased a watch on here before I bought the iTech fusion 3. The previous watch was one of those 159.00 ones with a super sale of 19.99 or something like that. Anyway, that 159$ one crapped the bed after like a week of having it. I noticed it when I was food shopping after work and I looked at it and it said I only did 1,000 steps while my phone tracked 16,000 steps. So I was on the hunt for another smartwatch and I came across this one and I figured why not try this next. I love it! I kinda wish it had more options when using your own photo for the background but whatever it's no biggie in that aspect. Charges fast, counts my steps accurately, love the watch band love all the features on it altogether! I recommend this watch!",

      "review_text": "the only thing I like about this item is that the band end tucks under the band so the floppy end doesn't get caught on stuff, however if you need to use the very end hole, the floppy end pops out. I wore the item for 2 days, it stopped syncing to the app. I thought maybe if I turned the watch off and then back on, it would start syncing. Instead, I could never get it to turn back on again - Even after sitting on the charger over night. It also only has selected apps for which notifications will work so if you have something like the Ring or Teams or something not included, there is no way to get notifications on the watch",
