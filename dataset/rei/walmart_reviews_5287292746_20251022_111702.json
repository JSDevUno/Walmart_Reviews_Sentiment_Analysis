      "review_text": "I first bought this Acer portable monitor for myself, and after seeing how much it improved my workflow, I immediately purchased a second one as a gift for a friend. The display is sharp, bright, and vibrant—perfect for both work and entertainment. It's lightweight, slim, and slips easily into a laptop bag, making it ideal for travel or working remotely. Setup couldn't be easier: just plug it in and you're ready to go. For me, it's been a total game-changer. Having a second screen on the go makes multitasking, presenting, and organizing so much smoother. My friend has been just as impressed with theirs, and it's already made a big difference in their day-to-day tasks. The build feels sturdy yet sleek, and Acer clearly prioritized both portability and performance. Honestly, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this monitor to anyone who needs more screen space without being tied to a desk.",

      "review_text": "I use this portable monitor with Samsung DeX, and it works flawlessly. The charging passthrough keeps my phone powered the entire time, which is a huge plus. I also place it right on my piano stand to display sheet music, including interactive apps. I use this for teaching music as well as for my medical work, and it's been incredibly convenient, very light, and easy to carry in your backpack or laptop bag. I also use it with the GeForce Now cloud gaming service, and it delivers a smooth, responsive experience. With a Windows laptop, it works just as well, making it a great all-around second screen. The built-in speakers are pretty bad, but that's not what this monitor is for. The IPS display is bright, sharp, and has great viewing angles, making it perfect for small presentations or sharing content. The only thing I would suggest is for the screen cover protector to have some sort of latch or magnet to keep the sleeve closed snugly. If you need a lightweight, portable second screen that just works, this is an excellent choice.",

      "review_text": "First off, I ordered the onn. brand and this was substituted because it was out of stock. I needed something immediately so just had to go with it. Surprisingly the .onn brand has basically the same specs, some areas even better than this one, and it's cheaper, but I didn't get to try it out. CONS: 1. The tilt of the screen. There are only two tilt options and both of them are too tilted IMO. I don't want my computer screen to be leaned back, I want it upright in front of me. 2. The cover isn't magenetic. It flaps around and doesn't stay on the front of the screen. It is nice that it's attached permanently at the back so it doesn't come off completely, but I wish it was magnetic to keep the screen protected. PROS: 1. It was on sale for $88 so that's a pretty good deal. 2. You can use a single USB-C to for power and display on your laptop. I had another portable monitor with the same ports as this one, BUT I had to use the USB-C for power and a mini-HDMI for display. It's nice to only need one connection. Ultimately, this worked for me needing something quick and it would've been fine, but the tilt is a deal breaker for me.",

Through looking at youtube reviews, i saw it was mainly used with laptops that took usb so i had bought a sub to vga adapter prior just in case. when i plug the provided usb cord into my phone, it turns on the monitor but says no signal. fine. so i pkug it into my computer with the provided usb c to usb a cord and still the same thing. i then plug in the usb c to vga adapter at the same time and still the same thing. i played around with all their cords before just returning it. Maybe im running a old computer but i think the compatibility of what it can be used with should be more clear. ended uo getting a onn 22 inch monitir and though not as sleek, its cheaper, light and has more options for input. worked on the first try. unless youre tech savvy and know what youre buying, i wouldnt buy this portable monitor.",

      "title": "Dual-screen experience on the go",
      "review_text": "I recently purchased the Acer portable screen to use as a second monitor while traveling, and overall, it has been a mixed experience. Pros: - The screen has a sleek and modern design, making it a nice addition to my workspace. - Picture quality is impressive, with clear and vibrant visuals. - It comes with three cables for connectivity: Mini HDMI to HDMI, USB-C to USB-A, and USB-C to USB-C, which is great for versatility. Cons: - Unfortunately, I couldn't get the Mini HDMI to HDMI or USB-C to USB-A cables to work with my laptop. I tried both through my Thunderbolt dock and a direct connection, but neither worked. - The only cable that successfully connected the screen to my laptop was the USB-C to USB-C cable. The same issue occurred when I tested it with my work laptop. While the screen itself is great in terms of design and display quality, the connectivity issues were disappointing even after updating the screen driver. If your laptop supports USB-C, this could be a great travel companion. However, if you rely on Mini HDMI or USB-C to USB-A, you may run into problems.",

It even has a sticker that says that it is refurbished; it came without any instructions or warranty information; the cord was wrapped up with a rubber band- none of this was in plastic as all new hardware comes in. This is clearly a used/returned/repaired product. I emailed the seller. Their reply: \"Hi, thank you for your message. This item is 100% brand new and unused in the package. We wanted to let you know that only the standard 30-day warranty is applicable for purchases made through Walmart\". (Acer's website states that their products have a one year warranty so this seller is simply stating Walmart's return policy). This is a BAIT AND SWITCH SCAM!

Im very excited! I also was surprised to find out there are speakers on the monitor. they are not super loud but pretty cool they have built in speakers. this screen is perfect for gaming too!! a kid or teenager WOULD love this as a gift. or a student entering college! i recommend this product.",

It's considerably brighter than OEM screen at 250 nits so I'm good with the setting at only 80%. Good color and contrast. The push button controls are a bit wonky but workable. Plug and play on my Dell Latitude 5590 using USB type C connector. I have not tried the mini HDMI or regular USB to type C interface. All three come in the box. Printed instructions are minimal, but if you're at this stage, you probably don't need them. Excellent product and I've shown co-workers who would enjoy setting up dual screens on the cheap at home as well, with many saying they intend to purchase as well.",
