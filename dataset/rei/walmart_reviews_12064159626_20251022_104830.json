For the most part, steps, heart rate, miles are in synch with other tracking apps/watches I am using. I do not like that on the watch, the calories burned are fraction of what my previous watch recorded (e.g. One-hour of yoga my previous watch showed around 250 kcal, this watch recorded 6 kcal) . Also, When I select outdoor walk on the watch, it does not open the walk tracking on the app on my phone and vice versa (again, about 30 minutes walking on watch recorded 66 kcal, app on phone 145 kcal). I also did not receive a verbal notification or vibration when I hit 1-mile as I do on my previous watch. The manual and website do not address these issues. I will likely return the watch but am testing it a few more days.",

Limited help on the app you have to download to set it up. Screens flash for about a second, can't see what you want to on that amount of time. Nothing that tells what the knobs and buttons do. Watch went beserk the other day after my walk , all I wanted was to check to see if the watch and phone came up with the same amount of steps, wouldn't shut off, I finally turned off the blue tooth! Weather/temp only works when it wants to, even then it's way below the phone readings, which makes me wonder if anything is accurate on this Watch.

That isn't a big deal. The real issue that we've had is with the screens breaking. We put screen protectors on them because they looked like they might scratch. Despite that when one girl dropped hers on a laminate floor and the screen shattered. Another bumped the side of a chair with hers and it also shattered. A drop of less that three feet breaking it surprised me, and I think that they should be able to survive accidentally running into a chair. They don't seem capable surviving of real life.

      "review_text": "I recently bought the CX3 Smart Watch, and I have to admit, I’m blown away by how advanced it is. It honestly reminds me of an Apple Watch but at a fraction of the price—and in some ways, it’s even better. The design is sleek, lightweight, and modern, and the display is bright and easy to read. Setting it up was super simple, and the connection to my phone through the Runmifit app was seamless. What really stands out is the Bluetooth calling feature—it works flawlessly, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for a smartwatch in this price range. The fitness tracking is accurate and covers all the basics like steps, heart rate, and calories, which is exactly what I need. The battery life is solid too. I get about two days of use, which is more than I expected given all the features it offers. Overall, this watch completely exceeded my expectations. It looks and feels high-end, performs like a much more expensive smartwatch, and is packed with features. If you’re on the fence about getting it, don’t hesitate—you won’t be disappointed. It’s hands down one of the best purchases I’ve made recently.",

It was dying pretty fast. However, I accidentally figured out how to save the battery life by A LOT! Bring up your list of options. Select Phone Call (turn off). Go back and select Settings ‐ Display - Turn on Wrist Raise (This lights up your watch every time you raise your arm/ wrist). I waited a few minutes, and then turned it off. My battery has been just below full for two days so far. Reducing the vibration or putting it on mute also provides better measurements. Actually, anything I'm not using is turned off until I need it. My only disappointment is the sleep tracker does not give a Last Seven Day Report unless I view it directly in the app. The rotating bezel is a huge plus for my fat fingers. The most valuable feature is the Find Phone. Misplacing my phone occurs many times throughout the day. Don't worry if your phone is on mute. It will continue to vibrate until you find it. Off mute, it sounds off pretty loud. Along with other shortcuts, and decent set of workout videos provided by the app, this was money well spent! I hope this helps.",
