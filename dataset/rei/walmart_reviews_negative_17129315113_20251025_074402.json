Unfortunately, mine has a pop stand and my phone does not charge. I did have to remove it from the case and t would charge then, but at a slower rate than if I plugged up my phone. Considering this wireless charger has a C cord connection and has to have a block to plug into an outlet to charge, I see no point in having it when you can use a wall charger.",
