      "review_text": "I live just south of Memphis in Mississippi. It's 1-7-14 and as you all know we are all having unusual artic temps, 10-20 degrees. Even though I left my faucet dripping my water still froze. I know nothing about fireplaces. I live in an apt with a fire place and I've never used it, but I thought I would give it a go in these artic temps. I bought 2 2-hour Duraflame logs from Freds. They lasted even more than 2 hours and I enjoyed the experience. I went to Walmart to check out the selection and bought a 6-pk box of 3-hour Pine Mountain logs. The first log burned big and fast. I thought maybe it did that because I lit it in 4 different places, so I burned another exactly following the lighting directions. The log still burned big and in and 1 hour not 3. Also the air filter on my central heater was black. Hmm, don't know if I'll give Druaflame another try, but definitely will not buy any more Pine Mountain. In fact, I'm going to return the remaining logs. I don't want to use any kind log if my air filter is going turn black. I didn't notice the filter after I burned the Dualame, but it was very noticeable after the pine mountain.",
