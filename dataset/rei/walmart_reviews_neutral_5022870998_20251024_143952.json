      "review_text": "Got this watch for my son (11yo) to have an inexpensive smartwatch. He started going on walks with me and wanted to count steps and calories. The app doesn't work; its like it is incapable of detecting the watch. However you can bypass syncing, and setup the watch without the app. The battery life is short, needing to be charged every day, he usually does this overnight. Other than that, it does what its supposed to do and he enjoys having it. I'm going to order one for my 9yo daughter, because it comes in her favorite color.",
