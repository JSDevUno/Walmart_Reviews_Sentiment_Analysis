This will be great for things aI can't do on my phone or tablet. Easily connected to WiFi and printer. Would definitely recommend for the money as I don't need a laptop for every day use. I was skeptical since it was refurbished but pleasantly surprised at the condition and how well it works.",

      "review_text": "I am a bit surprised that Walmart would allow a fraudulent Marketplace Supplier to run a scam on your portal. The subject order was placed with Walmart. Payment for subject order was made to Walmart. Subject order was returned utilizing the UPS Return Authorization Shipping Label paid for and provided by your Marketplace Supplier. Proof of Delivery of the return of subject order was provided to both Walmart and your Marketplace Supplier. All my attempts to follow-up with your Marketplace Supplier regarding a refund have been either ignored or summarily dismissed. Subsequent contacts with the Walmart Customer Service Department seemed to be spiraling into the black hole of your circular files. All requested responses to E-Mails from Walmart Customer Service, Customer Care and Payments sent to me go to their unmonitored address. Seems like there should be a better way to communicate!! I'm beginning to think Walmart could care less if this issue is ever resolved. Your assistance in resolving this lingering issue and providing the refund credit due would be much appreciated.",
