I ordered 2. One came in satisfactory condition, the other arrived with the front sticker around the controls peeling off and the digital display not showing the entire number, so I returned that one to the store without any difficulty. The digital display does not show the current temperature, just what it is set to. Also if you unplug and move, it resets to about 86° and you need to reset it. However it looks nice and keeps a large bedroom warm.",

It has a heavy duty cord, tip over switch and over-heat protection. The only con that I have found is, that the wood around the opening does get a little hot when operated on high, but stays cool in the low position, which by the way is the ONLY setting I use. It's ability to heat a room is greatly diminished on the low setting.",
