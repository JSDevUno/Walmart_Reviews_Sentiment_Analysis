      "review_text": "This monitor appears nice on the outside, as it is asthetically pleasing, however, once you get on the inside, nothing but disappointment lurks. This is one of those times where the old saying \"you get what you pay for\" comes into play. There is one, and only one, button on this whole screen and it is a toggle like a joystick that you would find on a game controller. Using this toggle is clunky and awkward, especially with your arm around the screen. Toggling through available selections and selecting something to change is a nightmare all in it's own. This wouldn't be such a big deal if I was only using one input but I often switch between the two and the functionality just ins't there. It's stupid, to say the least. My favorite part is that sometimes when switching between inputs, nothing happens, and you have to unplug the cable you're not trying to use. Lucikly my desk is set up in a way that I can get to the back of it easily, but I shouldn't have to. Aside from input control, the on screen text leaves something to be disired - the font looks...pixelated? I don't know how to explain it other than to say it is NOT clear. If it wasn't for the size of the screen, I would have trouble reading. I have not used this monitor for gaming, so I can't speak to that, but I have used it for streaming which is just o.k. The blacks aren't very deep and the colors are so so. I am using this as a second monitor to a Dell laptop and the Dell is crystal clear for comparison. Overall, this just wasn't a good purchase, and you can order the same monitor from Temu, if that tells you anything.",
