It continuously updates for more than a day and actually required restoring to a fresh windows install before it would update successfully. Now, after letting it update for over 24 hours it goes into update at each startup. Wish now I had bought a name brand laptop.",

You'll have to download it to the hard drive, and if you try to then upload it to Onedrive or Google, there might be problems. E.g. if you fill out a pdf then try to save it or move it to Onedrive or Google Driveâ€”-it will be blank and you'll have to fill it out all over again. It tries to force you to use WPS, but it's limited; you'll have to pay to do simple things like create two signatures to sign documents. Also, you can't disable edge. You can download Chrome or FireFox but the functionality defaults to Edge (so, you'll have to change a lot of default settings. But it will still run and slow things down.). Save yourself the headache and get a Chromebook or MacBook. Or an actual Microsoft or Dell laptop. They gave me a hard time returning it; make sure you keep the box.",
