      "review_text": "I have several WD Externals of various ages, they seem to last a good long time. Not sure if I have had an external fail yet. Works great especially if you have good USB 3.0 or 3.2 ports that can keep up with it and take full advantage of its high speed interface. I have a lot of machines for the work that I do and needed something fast and reliable to transfer a lot of files, store them, and then quickly return them to the server when it was ready after a recent equipment failure. Being able to order one up quickly on Walmart.com and have it brought to my home office in an hour is amazingly convenient and helpful. Where else can you get a 4TB external USB 3.0 HDD at 7:30 at night? Thank you.",

I had worked as a private school teacher for about twenty years, so I had accumulated a great deal of educational materials along the way - including audio courses, an extensive Ebook library, and obviously video and music. The 4TB disk is my storage library - allowing me to retrieve and/or share materials with others at lightning speed - while leaving my 1TB hard disk freed for routine, daily business. I highly recommend this product. And when it fills, buy another and lay it alongside. But most folks would probably not need more than 4TB to store their media.",

Later in retirement we continued to use Western external hard drives as backup to our computer drives. In the last decade we began using the external hard drive for all things and no longer relied on the computer hard drive to backup of personal files. We have had only one Western drive unexplained failure some years ago so starting backing up on two or more drives. We still have that drive and when testes after sitting for more than five years it starting operating as if nothing was wrong. Unfortunately it did not last and when shut down would never boot up again. So we still trust in their product after many decades. However we also suggest you backup the backup.",

I understand that this isn't an SSD, so the speed would not be as fast as my m.2, but I'm still impressed at how quick this little HDD moves.

This has, on several occasions, prompted me to purchase the product from other stores that provided full information about the product. It would seem to me that it would be easy to include that info if the person uploading the product on the WalMart website simply pretended to be the prospective buyer and asked themselves what info they would need to know before deciding to buy the product.

This device, ( of which i purchased two) an 18TB My Book, will be used here as back up to my 48TB G Raid 4 bay Shuttle. I do not use the cloud for storage and would prefer to house my own back up. My digital life began with an ever increasing number of By Book's in the 1990's, and then migrated everything to G Drive storage. What I have done now, in this purchase is consolidate 12 G drives into, 1 48 TB G 4bay shuttle and 2- 18 TB My Book drives to bring of my storage needs up to date, with space available for adding data for a few years to come.

No instructions in the box, nothing happened when I plugged it in. Thankfully YouTube has some excellent videos on how to setup and by going to the WD website I found the software needed to get the job done; although not all of it is there. WD sent me to the Acronis website for a free download on their software made for the WD hard drive. This is not a process for those who do not have some experience setting up computer equipment.

When I checked the drive, it didn't show errors so I checked the cords with alternatives I knew to be working well. The noise was not consistent so I attempted to load files. The files wouldn't show correctly as if they weren't loading onto the drive. When I closed the folder and reopened, they were there. This is also not normal behavior. I also noticed intermittent behaviors were the drive would load much slower than the rest (including another 12 tb with matching files). Sometimes taking 15-20 minutes (I'd give up on it loading and go do something else only to come back and it's loaded). It has caused disk utility to crash and I haven't had that happen before. DU only crashes or loads very slowly when this drive is connected. Sometimes the drive doesn't connect at all. I reached out for support but will likely have to exchange under warranty. I feel there is something not right and I have numerous WD EHD's, this one is not behaving normally. I have a concern of being forced into a refurbished option but my drive is only 2.5 months old and has had this problem since day one. I wish I'd gone with my gut for the exchange before the first 30 days. I am also concerned I will now have additional shipping costs despite that this drive was sent to me like this.",

      "review_text": "This is probably more of a review of walmart then the drive itself. That being said my drive doesn't work. Windows appears to recognize it but I cannot get it to initialize. I work in IT, so I feel like I know what I am doing. When I try to clear the disk attributes I get an error saying it failed due to a hardware failure. The reason I say this is more a review of walmart is that as soon as I got home I noticed the plastic stickers on the box that seal it were cut. Opened it anyway and the cords didn't have any sort of twist tie holding them neatly together, so I have to assume this was bought and returned and no one bothered to check it, they just put it back on the shelf. I wouldn't normally buy a hard drive from walmart, but I was in a rush and best buy didn't have any 8TD models and microcenter wanted way more for them and is a farther drive for me. But, this one is definitely going back. Make sure you check the packaging before you buy/leave the store. My fault for not doing that.",

The only issue with the setup that I noticed is that you have to be smart enough to go into disk management under administrative tools in control panel and assign the drive a drive letter before you can format it and use it. That is a bit different than many of the drives I have bought in the past, but it only takes a few seconds to do and is very easy to do. Also, that could be an issue with Windows 10 and not the drive itself. The 8tb WD drive I bought a few years ago is still doing its job with no complaints.",

The first drive opened with no problem and it had a white label 8TB drive inside. Installed in NAS and works beautifully. The second drive, however, would not open. One side was stuck and wouldn't budge. Since I had no plan to use the enclosure and only wanted the drive inside, I went ahead and used a screwdriver to forcibly crack open the enclosure to get to the drive. I was shocked/angered to see that it had a 320GB drive inside, not the 8TB drive it should have. Someone took out the 8TB drive and replaced it with a cheap 320GB drive. How it ended up back in the case with the others, available to sell with 2 uncut security labels I had to cut to open the box is beyond me. It almost makes me think it was an employee that did it. They had also glued one side of the enclosure tray which is why I couldn't open it. I was able to get a refund, but just wanted to give everyone a heads up that people are doing this and that even though the case appears to be new and unopened, that may not be the case.",

I know that there are more features such as accessing de server from the Internet but I do not need these. I use the Twonkey DLNA server which works very well with our smart TV. We are on Linux and 2 PC's are mounting this home server as an external drive for maintenance and archiving. I also like the energy saving feature which spins down the drive after some idle time. This saves energy and is preventing wearing out equipment. As I never had any problem at all I can recommend this for simple home server use.",

A file folder of my writing project book had been ruined by some attempt to link to those files. I needed to secure my files as I am readying to move to my new HP i7 with Windows 10. The drive will secure my files, along with some other offline storage for security. The 4T size provides room to organize my folders between my Windows 7 and Windows 10.

      "review_text": "What is the deal with WD products, currently I am having issues with 3 different of their products at once??!! My WDBFJK004OHBK My WD My Book hard drive is not working correctly, I was in the middle of downloading some files and shut my computer down to run errands and when I came back to finish the files my My Book was no longer showing up in my file explorer, it does show up under the section where it says eject item, it shows up in the drives manager but not the other manager. The hard drive is running, and light shows from the inside.( I ran the WD digital Data Life guard Diagnostics Tool and it shows the my book but says not available)As I said it was working perfectly and my errands took less than 30 minutes when it stopped showing in the file explorer anymore. The more I look into wd hard drives the more I find that thier products have a lot of issues that I did not know about when I looked into the research originally. I tried everything that was suggested. I plugged the hardrive directly into the wall, I shut down the computer a couple of times, I went in and unistalled the my book drive under all the areas you could do that and reinstalled nothing worked!!! this is ridulous how can their products have so many issues this one does not make sense. it was working and than it wasnt and I can not get to my files that I was back up which is the whole point of these products how is wd sitll in business seriously!? Issue 2 I plugged in my passport 2tb external hard drive that was working perfectly and has thousands of vids and other files on it into my WD live Media player to watch something off it and it played for a second (3 issues) but the purple screen that often happens with the WD media showed up again the files played fine but when I was done unplugging the hdmi cable it would not show the files on the screen anymore and now when I plug the passport in my computer to check it it will not show up on my File explorer or the drive file at all now!! This is Crap WD all of this has happened in just the past 3 days in the middle of another Covid shutdown, again how is this company still in business I now have several thousand files, and movies and things that I can now now find or retrieve or whatever!!!?? and these were my backups I only have some of what was on my My Book hardrive that is back uped on another hardrive but some of the best stuff was on this passport that suddenly stopped working or something??!Q!",
