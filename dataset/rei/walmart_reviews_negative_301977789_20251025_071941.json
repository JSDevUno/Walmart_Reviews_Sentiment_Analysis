I mean 278 for a 15.6 inch computer 16gb ram and 500gbs it's really cheap I shouldn't have expected it to be super good. But the top row being broken really does suck.",

My pocketbook took a big hit to get it even to even be able to download games. I had to buy an external storage. It only has one USB port so you have to buy a 3.0 for more ports. Mouse for it my daughter going to have to spend another $70 for a mouse we hope will work. I sent the seller 2 messages and no reply. Think this one had been returned because it shows a girl's name on the sign on screen. I'm really disappointed because I didn't have the extra money to spend. Buyer be ware.

I didn't get to reaching out to them until earlier this month because of things going on in life, but I still did it within the one year after sales period. They told me it would take several months for them to “repair” it and even then, it is “unknown”. I told them I cannot be months without a laptop, and they told me there's essentially nothing they can do. They then turned around and offered a replacement. I asked them if I would have to cover shipping costs to send the faulty product back, and explained that I cannot afford to send a laptop to New York (do y'all know how much that would cost? I can't do it, I'm struggling to get by right now). They got rude with me, saying that they won't cover the costs because I'm past my one year after sales period, even though I'm not? Then proceeded to tell me I agreed to a partial refund when I was never offered a refund nor did I agree to one, because I wasn't offered one? Even if I had been, I'm not agreeing to a partial refund for something I paid $310 for and haven't even had a year only for it be messing up already.",

The moment I got this it looked promising all the things are good to get on to like Reddit discord and other social media apps editing videos are good but gaming is bad, unless you want to play like if this laptop was made in 2010 and brought it up here and called it a new design so if you want a gaming laptop this is not for you. When I was playing the popular game crab game it was so laggy and it wasn’t my wifi I have good Wi-Fi and yea wouldn’t recommend also the voice bot sounds so 2000 and the other word designs looked back there to so yea ima return this and get a new laptop",
