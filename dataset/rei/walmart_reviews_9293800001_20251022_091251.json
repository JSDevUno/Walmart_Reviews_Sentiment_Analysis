      "review_text": "I wanted to love these. I really did. I'd previously owned two sets of X08's, one failed (one earpiece broke), the other set's going strong. So I do appreciate the VEATOOL brand and their reliable/affordable set of products When I seen these, I thought 'oh this must be the next new thing'. Touch screen, etc. Lets start with some of the more obvious flaws. 1. Frequently disconnects - also very easy to de-pair with the other headset and give you that wonky out of phase audio feeling. 2. Charge lasts about an hour. Makes me think that something's constantly trying to pair or work harder than it needs to, to maintain a connection. I've disabled noise cancelling and graphic equalization. Still doesn't last longer. 3. The textured coating on the earpieces (while nice) can become quite slick and leave you fumbling and accidentally touch the controls on the earpiece when you didn't intend to , cutting off a call or other. 4. Touch screen on case. Nice idea but it is fiddly. Doesn't work well with big thumbs. If you want a basic but reliable model, try the X08. Good battery life, wireless charging and average noise cancelling. I will try other models in their lineup in the future, but I think these ones need some TLC from VEATOOL before they're ready for prime-time.",

She put them back into the box and said \" I will take them on our vacation trip in a few weeks\". The week before we left on vacation (September) she got the earbuds out of the little charger box and was listening to them while we started packing, after a few minutes she said \"what's wrong with the screen on the charger box?\" I looked at it and the screen had fallen out in her hand. I understand these earbuds ain't Beats or Apple buds, but I didn't expect the touch screen to fall out before we really had a chance to use them. Maybe it didn't get glued in good at the manufacturer? I don't know... I have the VEATOOL T5 %26 V6 earbuds and they work very well with no issues so far.",

The clarity of sound is amazing and I like how you can block out background noise or allow you to switch it so you can hear some of what is happening around you. I use them at work where there are a lot of machines around me and they work great w/o interference. The only problem I had was that the charging cord that came with the earbuds did not work. I talked to the seller about this and they could only give me a $5.00 credit. I accept it but I do worry if the charging cord I use is safe for the earbuds. I hope this review helps you make your choice easier. I would buy again!",

I'm glad I did, he is super impressed at the quality and sound, with the equalizer option being impressive. Still learning all the functions of the charge case (an impressively small case with a little bit of weight to it).. but it's super cool and he says the earbuds are Super comfortable too. If you open the case and put them on, it will automatically connect to your Spotify or whatever you have it set too. I tried a phone call to him, and it shows little people icons for contacts you can set up. The call came through crystal clear, and his music resumed the second we hung up. The charge has held up well. The price is a steal right now, you would think these were a very expensive. If your experience is the same as ours you will not regret this purchase!",

I loved the earbuds but the 2nd one no one could hear me when I was talking so I couldn't use those at all for calls but if I wanna listen to music or something they will work perfectly fine. But I got ear buds for calls when I'm working I don't have to hold my phone on my ear. The bud covers are perfect they fit great holds awesome. The external noise is minimal and the sound is clear. I did not test the frequency range as I kept the box close on my arm or shirt with the string that comes with them you can attach to the box, which is the cooler part about the ear buds to me because I didn't have to put it in my pocket or hold it. All and all these could be the best ear buds but they have a few small kinks to master like the chargers and the volume that goes into the buds. Maybe I'll try them again if they bring out a updated version these.",

      "title": "READ BEFORE PURCHASING",
      "review_text": "Don't believe the 5 star reviews!! This seller is dishonest and scamming people. They've submitted hundreds of AI generated reviews, giving their faulty/defective products 5 stars. I totally fell for it too. I didn't read any of the individual reviews before purchasing. I saw “flash deal” $18.99 product usually worth (supposedly) $90, I saw a rating of 4.5 out of 1,400 reviews, and I read the summary of reviews generated by Walmart's AI bot, that said “customers rave about this product and how amazing it is..” etc, etc, etc. So of course I thought I hit the jackpot by finding these ear buds at this price, so I immediately bought 2 pair. (One black case and one with a pink case) After receiving them, I was actually pleasantly surprised with the packaging and nice look and feel of the case and ear buds. I liked that it had a display screen to always show the battery level of the case and each ear bud. They were really easy to pair with my Apple TV. BUT- when I started watching my show while using them… they were pausing and unpausing my show every few seconds, and completely disconnecting and reconnecting every 30 seconds or so. I'm not even exaggerating. It's so bad that these are completely unusable. I thought maybe the first pair was defective so I opened the second pair and they had the same issues. After all this, I decided to go read some of the hundreds of 5 star reviews. It was obvious that every single 5 star review is fake, AI generated reviews. All of the reviews and very similar in wording and length. Some of the reviews are just complete copies of other ones. All of the 5 star reviews are too perfect. Real people make typing errors, grammar and punctuation errors, spelling errors, and use abbreviations and/or slang. Just read thru a handful of them and you'll see what I mean. This seller should be banned from selling with Walmart. They are scammers and liars. I am embarrassed that I fell for it, but I'm hoping others will see this review and it can help prevent them from being scammed like I was.",

The ANC works well with background noise. the real test will come soon when running the lawn mower. I also like all the options and information on the small colorful LCD touchscreen. While this is a nice option and has good information about battery life, etc. you can do pretty much any of the necessary functions by multiple taps on the earphone pieces directly. The battery case is very compact and seems well built. All the seams are almost invisible, indicating a quality engineered product. The shipping package was well suited and was also well designed for the product. The price at Walmart for these was amazing, and the shipping was only 2 days from order time. I am very impressed. One last note: Customer service was extremely fast responce when I sent email about registering product for the extended warranty. Thank you for being so customer centric. This leads me to believe I picked a winner of a product! Way to Go!",
