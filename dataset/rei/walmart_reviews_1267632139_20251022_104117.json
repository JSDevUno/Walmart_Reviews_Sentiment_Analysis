      "review_text": "This is an SSD drive that connects through your USB, “A” or “C” port 3.2. Comes with two highspeed cables one with C to C, other A to C. What I like? • Small light weight being an SSD. • No movable parts to wear out (“maybe connectors”, if you are highly abusive). • Quite • No annoying blue lights distracting you like so many products have now. • Power is generated through the device hooked up to (no extra power cord/adaptor) What I don't like? No way to recover data if a critical failure occurs, it's an SSD. Use a back up program or service there's a lot of free ones out there. Conclusion? It's a great little drive and for its capacity it's a good buy.",

      "review_text": "I bought this product because i needed more storage on my computer, but i plan to upgrade in a few months due to Windows 10 end of support on an already aging computer, because buying a interal ssd to fit my exact motherboard wasn't worth it for only a short time. Overall, I've found the onn external SSD to be a mixed bag. The presentation was great when i opened the box. The drive came in a carrying case with 2 cables. The speeds, while not the fastest, exceeded expectations, and it is miles ahead of my old early 2000s HHD. It's lightweight and easy to carry if you want the same offline storage on your work and home computer. That all being said, it's got 1 big drawback, that being a huge discrepancy in storage capacity. It's listed as a 500GB drive, but mine only has 466GB. Normally, a slight discrepancy is common in budget storage devices sold today, maybe by a few GB or maybe 10 or 15 at worst, but a discrepancy of 34GB that's a lot of missing storage.",

I haven't tried moving videos yet, but I did move an entire folder filled with graphic design assets and it moved it easily in under a minute. Felt like seconds. The other thing I don't like is the 500GB size. We need terabytes of storage today, so this is much too small. But when they make the terabyte sizes, I say buy one asap. Until then only buy if you need this small amount of back up or added storage space. Thank you for allowing me to test and review this for you onn. and Home Tester Club, it's a great find.",

I was able to play video games stored on the SSD card with very little difficulties. I played the new Hogwarts game (almost 70 GB!!!) on medium settings with no buffering.",

While it would only hold 1-3 of the larger games, it does do a good job at holding smaller games. The response time loading from it is also good. For the curret cost it is well worth it.",

Then I copied everything to my PC with the USB cable provided with the kit. I can store so many files on the drive it's amazing, and the dive is small enough to fit in my hand. I highly recommend this product especially if you work from home, in any field working with computers, or just need extra storage you can take anywhere.
