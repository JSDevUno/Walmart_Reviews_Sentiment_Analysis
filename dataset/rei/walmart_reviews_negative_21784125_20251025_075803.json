The other has a \"T\" shaped angle adjustment knob and the bottom of the base is made to sit flat. This type makes a normal humming noise running. I tried returning the whistling one hoping to get another of the type that is better and just hums when running. Unfortunately, I got another whistling type as a replacement.",
