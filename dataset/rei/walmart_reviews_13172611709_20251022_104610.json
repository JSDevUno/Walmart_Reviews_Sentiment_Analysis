It comes with all the Microsoft for school , so that is great. I also use it to watch Netflix and prime video with no issues. I have not played any games on it so I cannot comment on that. I was babysitting and somehow someone broke the charger off inside it, but luckily it was easy to replace. I replaced it for $8. This laptop is great for the price especially for doing online college and watching movies.",

I don't usually leave reviews...so...would I recommend this Laptop? Yes. Will it run a few programs simultaneously? Yes. Will it run Minecraft? Yes. Will it run Battlefield? Real Buggy...Yes. Will it run VR? No. Can you run Debian and Windows side-by-side? YES. Can you run Video or Music editing software? Yes. Can you stream on YouTube? Yes. Can you rock out that mid-term essay you left for last minute, while hopped up on Spicy Ramen and Red bulls at 3 a.m.? You Betcha'. All in all if you're looking for a cheap priced laptop to do some work, that doesn't involve competitive gaming, or Launch codes programming, give this one a try. Besides...that 30 day Walmart return policy doesn't sit too bad either...üòÅ",

I had just started college again and knew that I needed a Windows Accessible laptop to complete my assignments throughout the semester. I read all the reviews and made the executive decision to try knowing that any of the negative references could be true! To my luck everything about this purchase was easy! The shipping was fast, I got the laptop delivered to me in 2 days respectfully placed on my porch. When opening the box, the first thing I noticed was the charger and the laptop in very nice condition and protected. I took both items out and opened the laptop immediately to go through and setup login information. The battery was 3/4 of the way charged and what would be considered the mouse, worked and continues to work perfectly! There's a camera cover as well that slides when you need to access the camera. I have owned this laptop now for three weeks and so far have no regrets. I am able to get all of my schoolwork done and sent to my professors stress free! I highly recommend this product and I hope you get the same great service I did!",

      "review_text": "Review: I regret buying this Intel Celeron laptop. From the moment I turned it on, it felt painfully slow. Basic tasks like opening a browser, checking email, or switching between tabs take forever. It lags constantly, freezes at random, and even struggles to stream videos smoothly. The Celeron processor is just too underpowered for modern use. Even with light workloads, it crawls. If you're hoping to use this for anything beyond typing a Word doc, you'll be disappointed. Multi-tasking? Forget about it. Loading updates? Go make a sandwich while it thinks about it. To make matters worse, the return process has been an absolute nightmare. Endless hoops, poor communication, and delays at every step. It's like they know the product is bad and want to make sure you give up before actually sending it back. The build might look okay on the outside, but performance-wise this laptop feels outdated right out of the box. Honestly, your phone will run faster. Spend a little more for at least an Intel i3 or AMD Ryzen ‚Äì you'll thank yourself later. Bottom line: This thing is cheap for a reason. It's basically a frustration machine, and even trying to return it is its own headache",

      "review_text": "Honestly, I was really excited about this computer are usually read the reviews thoroughly but that was a mistake. It looks good physically. The operating system look good. I was able to set up my email address, eager to get everything set up in general. I quickly realized that the camera quality was very very poor, wasn't clear at all very dark when I tried to adjust the brightness, the whole screen went white I tried to work with it turning on more lights in the room, etc. nothing work it wasn't even a standard camera. It was horrible. Seriously. After I (which is not even me) settled to keep the laptop because I know that I can plug in a portable WebCam) (but I shouldn't have to if I purchase something it should be quality 100% around across-the-board) I decided to keep it and use a plug-in WebCam because I was so eager to have a freaking laptop when I plug the charger into the outlet I got a very, very huge spark!!! Much much bigger than the average minor spark! Come to find out that spark calls, the charger not to work. I tried several chargers from my work laptops, my old laptop, and my daughter's laptop. None of them work I shouldn't have to purchase a laptop charger on top of the camera to have my laptop working that was the last straw. Lord knows what else I would have discovered the laptop is very very light super light, which kind of bothered me, but as long as it was working, compared to a standard laptop is not as light as the one that I purchase here. Anyway, I was able to get a refund thank God I turned it back into Walmart. Unfortunately I was not able to reset the computer to factory settings so that was disappointing because I could not get back into the laptop. Thankfully I did not have any personal information I only logged into Outlook and pulled up the browsing system , such a disappointment. Such time wasted on going to Walmart waiting for a refund waiting for AFFIRM to clear out my purchase. I now have another laptop on the way that has great reviews and great specs. Please do your research please re-all the reviews I even saw one laptop on Walmart website (not sold by Walmart because Walmart has different vendors that they can sell and use the Walmart platform) anyway one laptop review said that when people received it, they found a sticker for the 16 GB underneath the sticker was the real specs of only 4 GB and it was advertised for 16 GB so please read the reviews I am a real person. I would not take all this time if I did not care or wasn't real and want to help someone else. Do you research do you research on the vendor the person selling it the reviews the specs, everything thank you God bless each and every person reading this.",
