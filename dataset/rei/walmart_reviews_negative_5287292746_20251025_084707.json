The problem is with the HDMI plug in port on the screen if I fight with it long enough I can eventually get it to work , but it has became so bad it's not worth the trouble. I purchased this after I dropped my Acer Aspire 3 from about 10\" off the ground on to a carpet floor and the screen broke. I won't be purchasing anything from Acer again.",

This is clearly a used/returned/repaired product. I emailed the seller. Their reply: \"Hi, thank you for your message. This item is 100% brand new and unused in the package. We wanted to let you know that only the standard 30-day warranty is applicable for purchases made through Walmart\".

One USB-C cable hooks up your PM1 Series display to a laptop, sharing your display and transferring data while also supplying power. With this super-handy cable, you can also connect to your smartphone or tablet. I like the picture quality. There are just way too many cords.
