      "review_text": "So, I thought there is no way Walmart would be pulling something as shady as this, since I had previously purchased two boxes of 24 pack AA lithium batteries on two separate occasions without any catch. Well, was I wrong. I got the package today delivered FedEx and as soon as I hefted the package, I could tell something was off…and as everyone has stated in their comments there was only a four pack in the box (see attached picture). I immediately called customer service and they setup a return at the store. Of course, when I got to the store to return these the first thing they said was, “This is supposed to be a 24 pack.” I just said, “Exactly!” Needless to say, I got my refund. Walmart you really need to look into what is going on in these fulfillment centers. Either someone is siphoning off these batteries and screwing over the customer or you are deliberately defrauding the customer. What is it????",

      "review_text": "FYI – if Walmart edits and/or fails to post this spot-on review on walmart.com... ...I'll post it elsewhere online... ...on as many review websites as currently exist... ...AND then report Walmart for perpetuating its FRAUDULENT activities via attempting ( failing) to silence its VICTIMS. Important that review readers understand that – along with most or all other similarly-poor reviews THAT DATE AS FAR BACK AS AT LEAST 1 YEAR... ...this poor review is of WALMART... ...NOT of Energizer and/or its (GREAT) batteries... ...as Walmart ripped me off ALSO. Via exact-same SCAM: Order pay for 24 (Energizer Ultimate lithium AAA) batteries – then only receive 4. Formal complaint re: this Walmart fraud was emailed directly to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon several Walmart corporate minions-n-stooges ... ...unsurprisingly without ANY acknowledgement and/or apology – whatsoever... ... let alone a refund (initially).* *ONLY after I called Walmart cs SEVERAL times (AFTER being INTENTIONALLY disconnected SEVERAL times – aka: THE WALMART 'WAY')... ... (AFTER being instructed – yet REFUSING to drive to Walmart ON MY TIME AT MY EXPENSE... ...then ATTEMPT to explain Walmart FRAUD to understandably-skeptical cs rep) after DEMANDING full refund... ... did I receive my refund. BUT I DIDN'T STOP THERE. I ALSO reported these now-CHRONIC Walmart FRAUDS to: A: Energizer – which was STUNNED to learn of these Walmart FRAUDS thanked me profusely for taking the time making the effort for pointing out to Energizer how what SHOULD be poor WALMART reviews were adversely affecting Energizer sales. (Energizer assured me of a thorough investigation rewarded me for my time and efforts.) B: Respective FRAUD units of: 1: the FTC 2: CT State AG 3: CT DCP Commissioner – ALL of which will be thoroughly investigating these (to-date: unchecked) Walmart FRAUDS – in addition to several other Walmart FRAUDS. I encourage ALL other Walmart FRAUD victims to make direct complaints to the FTC respective state AG's DCP offices – ASAP. Obviously these investigations take time... ...so – it's not IF – but WHEN / how soon we'll be learning about MAJOR Walmart fines possible prosecutions. Stay tuned. DC copy: e-file 10/15/25",
