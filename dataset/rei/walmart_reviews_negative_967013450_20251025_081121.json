      "review_text": "camera setup was easy but don't know how to play the recordings it creates many .h264 files in each day and can't be opened with any player i tried VLC Preference > Input/Codec>Demuxers and selected (h264 Video demuxer) from the list but still it didn't work. I think its because that files size are very small almost all smaller than 5 MB. attached image shows 60 pieces of recordings in one folder in a night it should be one piece. and its worth to mention there are some JPG files inside it, it also can't be opened. the MMC card is also New and I was using it in my mobile till i put it in camera. please let me know how to fix it ? also is there any way that I should check the recording from mobile? as I can only see live video on mobile now.",

And if you think you just going to set this on the table a plug it in, thinks again. The power cord is maybe a foot and a half long. In other words, you might as well get an extension cord to go with. I didn't like the set up it took to long. And you basically have to set the camera on the WIFI box to hook it up. One more thing and it's a pet peeve of mine. Manufacturers of products that take SD cards should provide a starter card with their product. So you purchase this idem make sure to get an extension cord and an SDcard or you will be going back to Walmart to purchase them.",
