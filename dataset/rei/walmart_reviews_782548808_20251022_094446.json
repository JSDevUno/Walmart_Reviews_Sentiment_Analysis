      "review_text": "My daughter lost one of her AirPods months ago, and she wanted a brand new set, I suggested a replacement. Initially she was TOTALLY against the idea, thinking it would be dirty or not work as well, but I talked her into it. I tried the Apple Store first, and one AirPod replacement was the same price as a brand new set!! We did a quick search and Walmart popped up. As always ordering was a painless simple process, and was delivered on time for Christmas. The AirPod arrived in decent packaging, bubble wrap and easy to read/comprehend, instructions. The AirPod was beyond clean, not a speck of dirt on it, and is in like new condition not marred or scratched at all. Took no time at all to connect to her original AirPod case and her phone, no issues whatsoever. My daughter was very pleased!!! Lastly, you can't beat the price for the quality of an expensive Apple product.",
