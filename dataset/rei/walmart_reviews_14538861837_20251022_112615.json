      "review_text": "I was using an older version of this phone for a couple years with no complaints mostly (until near the end as to be expected) but also with no real raves either. Anyway, I decided to upgrade to THIS, the most recent iteration, as I figured I'd be somewhat familiarized with a new version of the phone I've been using for a couple years rather than jumping into something totally foreign and new. That was a smart choice, and the basic Motorola format, style, features, etc. all translated fairly easily, but I have to say that THIS 2025 model really is exceptional. It looks and feels modern, current, new. It's extremely fast, loaded with great features and apps (a handful of unnecessary/unwanted preloaded apps), the camera is fantastic, tons of storage and a mind boggling amount of storage can be added. Overall, I am very happy with this phone. Enamored enough, in fact, that I eagerly explore every feature and look forward to discovering more. I don't think I've ever had a phone that I was THIS much into right out the gate, and that really says a lot. Excellent!!",

To have my other phone re-activated, and ordered a different phone, before I ended the call. I can only assume that the company sent me a refurbished phone, even though it is not mentioned anywhere in the ad. And by the way. That customer service representative who handled my complaint was stellar and great! Also, I can't do a return, cause the phone will not charge. As in, it will not hold a charge. it lights up zero. So I cannot return it back to factory settings. My info is still on the phone. I know now that my seven years of bad luck begins with this company(Motorola). Money down the toilet.

Luckily they left a message & it was recorded there & also in my visual voicemail as it was an important call as it was a from Dr office of whom my Dr referred me to to make an appointment to a cardiologist, so that was a terrible glitch for me personally so why I took a way another star.",
