I found them to be too clingy around my fat, and I'm not wearing shapewear with a t shirt. I am a plus size, so if your not that, these could work well for you. I much prefer the Terra and Sky shirts over these only because these accentuate the upper belly and back fat so much and those are more forgiving.",
