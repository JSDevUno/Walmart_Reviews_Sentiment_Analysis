I like that I can change the stand on it and also plug headphones directly into the microphone itself. The microphone does have a little weight to it making it feel quality.

Included is an instruction manual, and USB connection cable. Plug in and you‚Äôre ready to rock. There‚Äôs an adjustable desk stand to calibrate to your liking. Because the base has a rubber base, it stays stable on the table without toppling over. The sound quality is really nice and clear with minimal to no feedback. I‚Äôve used it for work zoom meetings and for making videos of our family life. It allows me to use on my Windows computer, but it‚Äôs also usable on a Mac. I love that this is affordable with good construction. Really a favorite of mine.",

      "review_text": "I am actually a bit surprised by the quality of this USB microphone. I was expecting something lighter, maybe made of plastic, but this is a solid, microphone with a good amount of weight in the metal base. Having this kind of weight allows it to sit on a desk or table without being easily knocked over. Package comes with one microphone, a USB cord, and instructions. The mic, itself, has a headphone jack and USB-C port, and then also includes a 1/4\" threaded hole for mounting to a stand. The great thing about this mic is how simple it is to use-- You just plug in and play. It's compatible with Windows, Mac, and Chromebook. Quality of the sound and recording is decent, and the mic has the ability to make cardioid and omnidirectional recording patterns too! Great microphone for recording professional podcasts, vlogs, videos, and voice-overs for gaming!",

      "review_text": "There was a time a few years ago when the computer mounted microphone was sufficient. Times have changed. I needed an external mic that is able to capture natural sound. Came across this onn. microphone and wanted to give it a try. I got to say I am not disappointed. The clarity is far superior to other USB mics that I have used and light years ahead of the internal PC microphone. I tested the internal against this onn and the results are immediately obvious. Much crisper frequency response on the onn. While the body of the microphone is plastic the unit does have nice weight to it. The plastic construction does not detract from my opinion. It has all the features and functions of a much more expensive microphone. It's got a nice gunmetal gray finish that goes perfectly with any PC. I wasn't expecting much considering the price and I've got to say I am pleasantly surprised! Same quality and function as a much more expensive unit. If you need a studio mic, give this one a try!",

      "review_text": "We have several other products by this manufacturer and have always been happy with their products. So this microphone is no exception. It is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to record high-quality audio with a versatile and easy-to-use microphone. This microphone has two recording patterns - cardioid and omnidirectional - which makes it ideal for a wide range of recording scenarios. The cardioid recording pattern is perfect for recording sound from a single source, such as a person speaking directly into the microphone. On several runs it perfectly picks up sound from the front of the microphone and rejects sound from the sides and rear, which helps to reduce background noise and improve the clarity of the recorded audio. Excellent for anyone dabbling into podcasting etc. The omnidirectional recording pattern, on the other hand, is ideal for recording sound from multiple sources or for capturing ambient sound. It picks up sound from all directions, which makes it perfect for recording group conversations, musical performances, or environmental sounds. One of the best things about this microphone is pretty easy and straight forward to use. It connects to your laptop via a USB cable and requires no additional drivers or software. Simply plug it in, select the recording pattern you want to use, and start recording. We have not used it with any other devices such as tablets or if it integrates with a phone as seamlessly as with our laptop. But given how nicely it has been made, we imagine it would be a simple process there, too. In terms of sound quality, this microphone delivers excellent results. Perfect for our house needs recording kids videos and all. It seems to be able to handle professional grade recording just fine as well. Pretty decent signal-to-noise ratio, which helps to reduce background noise and improve the clarity of the recorded audio. So, overall, we would highly recommend this microphone to anyone who needs a versatile and easy-to-use recoding device for high-quality audio. Whether you're a podcaster, musician, video creator, or simply use it for family needs (as we do) this microphone is sure to deliver excellent results.",

      "review_text": "This little microphone is pretty impressive. Cardioid and omnidirectional mode options provide great sound options for podcasts or general voice recording. It's heavier than it looks and even though it's plastic, it doesn't feel or look like a budget friendly microphone. I wanted to try it out and expected to go through some song and dance click fest with warnings and software download prompts, but I got none of that with this on an iMac. On a side note, you may or may not have to set your audio input in the settings if you want to keep it attached and set as default. The USB to USB-C cord is plenty long and feels very durable. On the back of the microphone you have options. You can attach headphones using standard 3.5 mm jack. There's also the option to switch between cardioid or omnidirectional audio. Cardioid mode picks up sounds that are coming from a more precise direction (straight ahead) and omnidirectional picks up all sounds from all directions. There's also an option to attach the microphone to a tripod or hang it to prevent tipping or knocking it over if it's on a desk or table. The button on the front has two colors to let you know when it's muted or actively recording. Blue is recording, red is muted. This is useful in two ways. You can be assured you're not getting any unwanted sounds and also allows for another person to use their own microphone without anyone shifting places or weird scratching sounds while adjusting or moving the microphone. I have thought about doing a podcast in the past and now I know that if I decide to follow through with it, I have the most important piece of equipment in order to do it! Very cool little mic!",

      "review_text": "Received this item and couldn‚Äôt wait to hook it up and try it out. Has a great feel to it and is a very attractive mic. The stand is adjustable which is a must. It is compatible with windows, mac and chromebook. USB hook up and a headphone jack make this item useful for everyone in one way or another. Turning the volume up or down on the mic is a breeze and it has a handy dandy power indicator light. My son has it connected to his computer for gaming and he really likes it. His friends online say they hear him loud and clear without any distortion. A good product from the onn company.",
