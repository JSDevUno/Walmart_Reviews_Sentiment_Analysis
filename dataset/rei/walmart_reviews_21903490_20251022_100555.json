      "review_text": "I love this little fan! It's one of my fav purchases of the year. I use it every day, especially nights. As I need some air blowing on me while I sleep. Very low background noise. low space profile. It has two speeds. And there is a noticeable difference between them. They both give off good breeze and not an overpowered wind blow. The clip to hold the fan is big and it opens pretty wide as mentioned in the description. It was a concern as to where I would clip it before I ordered but it was for naught. Your table or edge will need at minimum a good 2 inch cleared length of edge if that is where you want to put it. The clip opens pretty wide too appropriately 3-4 inches. It opens wide and will require some hand strength. Once it's clipped on, it has the death grip on the edge or ledge. It will stay on unless you are fiddling around and pull it off. Yeah, I may have done that. It was totally user error tho. Not \"cool breeze\" fault. That's MY fan's name. Lol. Cool breeze gives a strong steady breeze. While white colored, not apparent collecting dust so far. However, all Fans will eventually do the dust collector thing. The fun part is that Cool breeze's head will and does tilt, swivel, flip, dip, dive and twirl to whatever direction your heart desires. Her wish is your command. She also has a twist knob so you can lock her into whatever configuration you want. This may be problematic for those with arthritis. The knob is small and in an awkward but convenient place. Again Her wish is your command. So, If you need a small breeze pointed on you or in your space and don't want a bulky fan sitting on your table or floor in your way, taking up valuable space, then this fan is for you. I don't think you will be disappointed. I am not and I was very skeptical. I am considering buying another for my laundry room. Enjoy.",

      "review_text": "Won't move a lot of air because, well, it's a small diameter fan. Moves enough for my use within a couple feet of cooled area. Quiet. Would prefer a rotary speed/off select than the slide switch. Like it can be pointed downward since it sits on an above shelf to blow downward. Does not oscillate, but I already knew that, and don't need it for where it is used. Would like the fan blade cage to be easier to separate for dusting (have to use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the halves apart to get inside to dust the blades). I had one before, and this was a replacement. After near 4 years, the old one's motor bearing were getting noisy. Note: The fan blades are simply pressed onto the motor spindle, so friction holds the blades to the spindle. When pointed straight down, the blades will gradually slide off the spindle which will have the blades bang against the cage. Used hot-melt glue to affix blades to spindle. The clamp was sufficiently wide to handle affixing the fan to my headboard (which has a layer for the headboard, and another layer around the edges for decorative trim). This is very quiet which is needed for a fan near the head when sleeping in the bed. The slow speed is enough to cool me off when sleeping (to eliminate waking up sweaty). The head can rotate fore-aft and the stem can rotate 360 degrees, so it pretty much can be pointed in any direction.",

It was quite soothing until a subtle little thump thump thumping started. And then it got louder. And louder. And louder. It seems the motor is vibrating inside the plastic caseing. Then another fun sound started. This one was a high pitched eeeeeeee that sounded somewhat metallic. I have no idea what that was about but that one was a deal breaker. It's going back to the store.

      "review_text": "I live in an area that is quite warm. I live in Arizona and it's 98 Degrees and it can go up to a hundred and twenty degrees I buy these little fans they're $11. I have them on my electronics. They I live in an RV recreational vehicle. I have one of those fans aiming at my DVD player oh, my VHS player. But I have it also in the cabinet that keeps the heat down on my DirecTV satellite monitor. I have one outside shooting cool air in on my RV refrigerating unit. In the summertime they don't keep cool and your food is at about 45-50 degrees. You can't do that I aim a fan inside that door to my refrigerator. And I plug it in outside and it blows constant cool air on the refrigeration unit. Keeping my freezer down to 5 to 0 degrees and it keeps my refrigerator at 30 degrees. Food last longer. My beer is cool and cold. My milk stays fresh. that's what happens when you live in Arizona the high temperatures destroy your your refrigerators and your electronics because it runs non-stop to try to stay cool and they can't do it they burn I just had a microwave go out on me because of the heat I was boiling water. and I have a small 2 cubic foot refrigerator with a freezer and a refrigerator unit I put one of the fans blowing air to the coolant and the cooling of the refrigerator. these fans for $11 I have three of them. That keep all of my appliances cool and running properly. You may want to put one and your RV on your electronics you know most electronics are in cabinets it gets warm in there even if you leave the door open.",

It need to be thin enough but also deep enough for the clip to actually work. Also the cable was too short for my needs. Anywhere near a socket was not able to reliably grip and anywhere it could grip would need an extension cord.",

My only complaint is that the clip part doesn't rotate much more the what's pictured. The fan itself rotates but the clip can't be put on a cubicle wall in front of you or something like that.
