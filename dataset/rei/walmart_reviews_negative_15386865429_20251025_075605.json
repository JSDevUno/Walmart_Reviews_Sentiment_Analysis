The necklace fans are great because they're rechargeable, but that's only good for mom. because I can't get the angle right to put it in the stroller. it's dangerous for a baby to be around strings.

The Honeywell wasn't available, and it being hurricane season, decided to give this one a try. What a mistake. Firstly, when I received the fan it was clear that it had been used and the previous owner had been kind enough to stick the cables severed usb port to a sticky label, so it wouldn't get lost. I decided to try it with batteries which only lasted a few hours, compared to my Honeywells that run for multiple days. Unlike the Honeywell it has multiple speeds. The profile is bigger than the Honeywell, but only has a third of the power. It died after 2 weeks of occasional use and 16 batteries. I'm usually happy with Mainstay products, but this one needs to be pulled from shelves.",
