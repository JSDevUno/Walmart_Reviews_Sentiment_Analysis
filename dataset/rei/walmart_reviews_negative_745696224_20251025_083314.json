I also changed the audio settings and stuff yet it still caused a really bad Echo). I have a habit of pushing one side of the headset off so I have an ear exposed, this headset is very very bulky and for the first few minutes it is comfortable but after that it starts to kind of hurt. If you wear the headsets normally they might end up working fine for you but if you like to have one ear exposed they definitely are too bulky for that. I ended up returning mine and getting a less bulkier headset for a few dollars more.",
