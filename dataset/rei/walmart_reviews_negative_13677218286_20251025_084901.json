      "review_text": "I have used Moto g phones for yhe past 10 years but before that I had an old Samsung Galaxy 5? It was great. Im having problems with Motorola. Their budget phones under 100 bucks are getting worse every year. Unfortunately this Samsung has not exactly blew me away. Its slow. When I'm out of the house I use ATT service. Its always been a bit slow but...this phone is taking over 2 minutes to open an app. At home using the wifi it even drags.Trying to type this review the phone cut off twice. I can't believe that people like this piece of sh%23t. Its too bad because Samsung makes good budget phones. Or they used to.Now they make 5000 dollar televisions. Dont buy this phone if you enjoy communicating.It sucks.",

They shipped it to me and it wasn't scanned therefore I can't use it at all. I spoke to agents with no help at all. They kept telling me to go to the store, However that's the reason for DELIVERY in the first place. I can't get to the store. They never have anything on track . I'm a faithful longtime Walmart customer and Walmart has done nothing but fail me over and over. After this, I'm sure I'll be taking my business elsewhere!!",
