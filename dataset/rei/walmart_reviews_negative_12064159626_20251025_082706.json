Limited help on the app you have to download to set it up. Screens flash for about a second, can't see what you want to on that amount of time. Nothing that tells what the knobs and buttons do. Watch went beserk the other day after my walk , all I wanted was to check to see if the watch and phone came up with the same amount of steps, wouldn't shut off, I finally turned off the blue tooth! Weather/temp only works when it wants to, even then it's way below the phone readings, which makes me wonder if anything is accurate on this Watch. Should return it, maybe I got a bad one, and never should have got the extended warranty!!",

That isn't a big deal. The real issue that we've had is with the screens breaking. We put screen protectors on them because they looked like they might scratch. Despite that when one girl dropped hers on a laminate floor and the screen shattered. Another bumped the side of a chair with hers and it also shattered. A drop of less that three feet breaking it surprised me, and I think that they should be able to survive accidentally running into a chair. They don't seem capable surviving of real life.

I upholds all the promises it makes until the watch refuses to charge. 🫠 This is the second watch Ive bought from Walmart just for it to stop charging THE DAY TO A MONTH PAST THE WARRANTY RUNNING OUT. My warranty ran out in july and it stopped working over a week ago. Since I have bought 3 seperate charges and docks to try to see if those were the issue. I dont know how it could have been damaged as i immediate put a protector on it, i dont get it wet - even though it claims to be water proof- and still have the same issues as the last watch. You get what you pay for I guess.",
