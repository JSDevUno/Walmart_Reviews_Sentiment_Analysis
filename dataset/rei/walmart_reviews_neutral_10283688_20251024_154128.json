      "review_text": "Ok, so technically they will work. Depending on what you're using them for, a few caveats: 1. The bars are hollow, instead of typically being solid. Looks like a big hollow tube is welded on a little hollow tube. Not sure how this will affect durability, though mine haven't broken so far. 1a. The welds are not clean; because of the welds, the plates won't sit flat against the inside collars. 2. The spring clips are junk. If you're using heavy weights, you'll need a screw on or other type of heavy-duty collar. Overall, these will probably work for most aplpications. If you're using heavy weights (which is why i opted for olympic bars), especially with the dumbbells, which tend to take more abuse than the curl bar, you're probably better off getting a higher quality solid set.",
