Most size charts that give more than one number size for the letter size will fit that range. Not these. XL on all the tags but the sewn in tab states it is a size 16 whereas the size chart states an XL is 16 and 18. I prefer my bottoms to have some room. These shorts are fitted so every curve shows. At a 16, these fit but have no room. Anything added to the pockets would make an undesirable bulge. I will be taking them on vacation but do not have confidence that I will experience much comfort trying to put them on if I am wet. Even with 7% Spandex, there is not much give. It really is a shame that the fit is so off as these are super cute and well made.",
