      "review_text": "Context: this is the viral Dubai Chocolate bar, while most premium Chocolate bars of equivalent size are $5 this one is $15. So at 3x the price my expectations are reasonably high. The results: the bar had barely any filling and the milk chocolate completely overpowered what little filling there was. For reference I had just had nutty %26 fruity brand Dubai Chocolate bars which had almost 3 times the filling. Chocolate itself was good but could barely make out the pistachio and kadayif which was the whole point of getting this bar vs a milk chocolate bar for 1/3rd of the price.",
