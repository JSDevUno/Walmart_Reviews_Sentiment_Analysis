I contacted Walmart and the customer representative was very helpful and reached out to the seller for them to contact me. They emailed stating the package was delivered on this date. I replied it was not delivered and I would like a refund. Waited a few more days, no response. I contacted Walmart again, again they reached out to the seller to contact me. The second email from buyer basically said it was delivered check with neighbors or family members to check receipt. I replied back that I have cameras, my neighbors have cameras and nothing was delivered. I also advised them that delivery services take pictures of the package when it's delivered. I got the email it was delivered but no picture. Walmart was very helpful in every aspect of this. I only gave a low rating so they would take notice of their 3rd party seller on marketplace. I finally did get a refund from Walmart.",

So I, myself, use separate USB for all school documents and didn't download any extra apps. Anyways, it is a stunning computer with a very easy and convenient feature - Google Copilot / or gemini AI.

      "review_text": "Having previously owned an EliteDesk G4 Tower I was expecting the Elite G9 to be a natural progression. However, I have mixed views. While the larger amount of RAM, the better processor, and faster USB ports were an immediate benefit, I was disappointed that HP has removed the rear line-input and didn't fit an optical drive. I was aware of the missing input, and I've had to utilise the front socket. However, I was misled about the optical drive. I had asked the sales support if an optical drive was fitted, and I understood it was. It isn't. It may well be possible to fit one later, but that's not the point. Also, I've mixed feelings about HP Wolf Security. Having read a lot of reviews I'm in two minds whether to replace with my trusted alternative. However, having said all that, I'm looking forward to years of reliable service. If the G9 does as well as the G4 I'll be well pleased.",

      "title": "HP Brought the Heat with this!",
      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This has to be, one of the best PC's I ever used, the combination of discrete components (fantastic processor, good RAM amount and speed, excellent storage, vibrant and clear display, excellent port availability, sound and built in tile capability). Beginning with packaging and a nod to sustainability, I love the simple cardboard recyclable box - I appreciate this more than having an elaborate and wasteful unboxing experience. Keep the cost lower, keep it simple - love it. The hardware itself has ocean-bound plastics and recycled aspects in it. Also, well done HP. This is exactly right - keep on this, we care! The power supply as a side note, had a great wrap around the cord - something that gave it a bit more personality and a nicer aesthetic. I appreciated this, though would never have expected it - but I like it! This originally had Windows 10 Pro on it, but upgraded to Windows 11 without issue swiftly with the updating process - my preference as well to be on 11. The machine is zippy, it handled multiple apps open, HD video playback and some intense computational tasks (lots of spreadsheet work) simultaneously - I did not notice any lag or the hardware skipping a beat. The keyboard is indeed quiet, much quieter than a few other large name brands I have, and the feel was soft to the touch. The trackpad was large, and responsive - sensitive almost and I had to dial it back a bit for my tastes (which are fully customizable). There is a built-in Tile feature, which I didn't seek out specifically, but it is interesting to have and has come in handy once already. Who knew, I would misplace my laptop. Camera quality is good, best in plenty of light - low light you can see the grain and artifacts pop up - so proper lighting setup applies here for those late night video calls or low-light conditions. Audio is bonkers. The B&O's do justice on web playback and streaming - really not bad for a laptop, and they grow on you for sure. The machine is a little heavier than I would have thought, not an issue, but I did notice it picking it up for the first time -it doesn't come to mind now but was one of those first impression items. The body is seems predominantly metal, durable and has held up - with some plastic (display case looks to be). Keyboard backlighting is good, helps in low light conditions as well but is not overbearing. I also enjoy having the fingerprint scanner - I'm not a fan of face recognition (which it can also do) so this is a great alternative for me. In all, its a very fast, powerhouse of a machine with very forward thinking capability. It will last me a considerable amount of time without replacement. Very happy with it, go HP on this one!",

      "title": "Incredible laptop!!",
      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After using this laptop for a few days I'm super impressed! It comes with options that I would want (i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, Nvida T550 GPU) and is crazy fast. It's not as common to have a dedicated GPU in most laptops now, but I highly recommend it if you'll be doing anything creative with photo/video/design/etc and this one does not disappoint. My biggest surprises so far are how much I like the fingerprint scanner (seriously, it makes logging in feel easier than unlocking my phone) and how great the screen is. Colors are fantastic, the display is very sharp, and the viewing angle has to be close to 180 degrees. I have a work laptop (different major brand) that is meant to be at a similar level but I didn't realize how disappointing the screen was until I started using this one. A slightly different approach with this laptop is to use 1920x1200 instead of 1920x1080. It feels the same which is good, but also gives more space vertically for all the toolbars at the top of programs which can take up way too much space on a laptop screen. I am also shocked at how good the speakers are, I love audio and have a fantastic home theater setup...which this doesn't compare to and I wouldn't expect it to. But I've never heard laptop speakers this good before where it's not painful to listen to music like it's in a tin can, these (separate right/left speakers) are enjoyable and can get plenty loud! I'm not sure how much of a difference the Wolf Pro Security will make but I guess time will tell. Having a Tile built in is a great idea and really enhances the physical security. It's slightly heavier than I was expecting but it's really not bad at all, it feels sturdy which I'd much rather have than something light and flimsy. The camera is sharp in bright light but pretty grainy in dim lighting (common on every laptop I've used), but I do appreciate the built-in camera cover that you can slide over.  The computer was quick to set up, connected flawlessly with my wireless HP printer in a few seconds, and it also connected right away with my dock (from a different brand) and could handle the laptop screen plus two other independent external monitors (I love USB-C docks and being able to connect everything with 1 cord including charging it). Speaking of cords, the power cord that comes with it is really cool, almost like a cloth feel instead of the usual plastic/rubber that every other laptop cord I've ever used has felt like...just a nice unexpected bonus! I work in software development, have had jobs in graphic design, video and photo editing, and worked in technical support/helpdesk environments for years so I'm pretty picky...but I can't say enough good things about this computer! I've used plenty of other brands in the last few years and hadn't really thought of HP as a major contender for a high-end laptop but this ZBook has absolutely changed my mind!",
