      "review_text": "I was looking for some kind of container that I could put my camping kitchen in. I like that there are 3 compartments and it has wheels. I don't know how long the latch will last. The latch is not very strong. This same toolbox is sold on Amazon for 20.00 more but comes with some small containers that fit in one of the top side compartments. The extra containers are helpful for small kitchen stuff like clips, ziplocks, and spices for my camp kitchen. I bought one from both places. The second toolbox I use for my small tent supplies. I am 62 year old woman so the wheels on them are nice. I just came back from my first camping trip. They worked well for the trip but I don't know how long they will last.",
