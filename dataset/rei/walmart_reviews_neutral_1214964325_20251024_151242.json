      "review_text": "I don't know why when I ordered this device that I thought it was much larger than it actually is. But, for a small massager, it does fairly well. After exercising or if I just have a sore muscle, it does seem to help breal up the lactic acid. I had hoped the head would move more in and out instead of just vibrate. The tips are nice to change the placement or pinpoint an area. It has 2 speeds which the higher speed seems to do more to relieve discomfort. The only other con would be that it didn't come with a small travel bag to put it and all the other tips in. Since it's supposed to be portable, a carry bag or strage bag of some kind would have been nice.",

I never use the lo speed. It is very weak. I use this mostly for a foot massage and for my hands. I have arthritis in my hands and colder temps make my hands ache. I just hold this little vibration massager in each hand several times during the day and that eases the pain most of the time completely. I also use it on my knees. It is a light massage, but any massage helps me. Homedics is a reliable brand.",
