One was manufactured perfectly but the other 2 had sheet metal forming booboos that needed to be corrected with vise grips and pliers and the kind. If I was not mechanically inclined, it would have probably been a big deal. But as it was, I just bent it back to how it needed to be to allow assembly and it was a minor thing. Fitting the doors so they closed easy was not easy but I banged on it with a hammer in the right places and put spacers on the hinge pins where they needed to go and the results are I am quite happy with all 3.",

It is exactly what I would expect for a sub-$100 cabinet... thin, cheap sheet metal, some screws that strip easily, and sub-par instructions. However, that being said, in the end the cabinet stands (it's fairly sturdy, considering the thin metal), shelves hold, doors work and handle mechanism works and locks (just don't plan on securing your life savings in this cabinet). Provided you set your expectations accordingly, this is a decent cabinet for the price that does what it should.",
