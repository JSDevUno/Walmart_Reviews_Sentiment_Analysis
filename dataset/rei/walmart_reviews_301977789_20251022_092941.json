      "review_text": "OMG, what can i say about the quality of the product. 2K display which is Crisp and neat (match to my iMac 4.5K) all metal casing. Flawless performance with all the regular work and MS office suites. This is what i was looking for a long. and I am so so happy about the laptop itself. This is a piece of metal who is looking for compact sleek stylish.. i am not wrong choosing CHUWI. i will look for more laptops of 2K display that is upcoming form Chuwi.. I had a bad impression about Celeron. never thought Celeron tied with 8 gb ram and 256 gb SSD will outperform this WELL!!!! Color reproduction is outstanding. And windows 11 upgraded as well Thanks, Chuwi for these items with the great price and specs!!",

      "review_text": "First thing I did was a fresh install of Windows 11, highly recommended if you want to ensure no bloatware or hidden software. The problem is that once I installed the Windows ISO, all drivers were missing, including the touch pad. I had to use the Tab, Space bar, and Enter keys to navigate through Windows. Windows update did not reinstall the drivers. I had to use a different computer to download a zip file with the Chuwi drivers, and then proceed to use the Tab, Space bar, and Enter keys to reinstall all drivers. I have not had to use this process of installing drivers since Windows XP. Once all drivers were installed, the laptop works great. It is very responsive and a great value for the price paid. Battery life could be better, but it lasts as expected.",

Mouse for it my daughter going to have to spend another $70 for a mouse we hope will work. I sent the seller 2 messages and no reply. Think this one had been returned because it shows a girl's name on the sign on screen. I'm really disappointed because I didn't have the extra money to spend. Buyer be ware.

If you don't like heat generation, you can choose the jumper ezbook x7 or the TECLAST F7Plus. the keyboard layout is different, so you may have different preferences, but I had no complaints with either of them once I learned. jumper's performance is much lower, but if you use it normally, it's not too stressful to use the internet. It's a little hot on the back of the device, but you don't notice it when using it. The other one is a little hot on the back, but you don't notice it when using it. However, for everyday use, this one is more functional and satisfying, and if you don't play games, You Tube and the Internet are crisp. A friend of mine wanted a cheaper computer, and I had the opportunity to buy two of them, so I could compare them. The price of both was about the same, about 340 US. I almost never use the keyboard in my daily life, and the other person does. Since I don't care about heat generation and durability, but my partner does, I chose this one and he chose the jumper.

It's not light, but it's not heavy either. Battery life is disappointing. However, it is usable. The most annoying problem is that the function keys cannot be used unless they are pressed simultaneously with the Fn key. This is a fatal flaw for Japanese input, and a big problem for work, so I emailed support (Aftersales), and in a few exchanges, they told me where to find the EF file and instructions. I managed to deal with the errors and unclear points in the instructions by myself, and in no time at all, it changed to the normal function key behavior. I really wonder why they don't make this the standard, even though the forum has a lot of complaints about the Fn key. Nevertheless, I'm very happy with the way it turned out.",

I didn't get to reaching out to them until earlier this month because of things going on in life, but I still did it within the one year after sales period. They told me it would take several months for them to “repair” it and even then, it is “unknown”. I told them I cannot be months without a laptop, and they told me there's essentially nothing they can do. They then turned around and offered a replacement. I asked them if I would have to cover shipping costs to send the faulty product back, and explained that I cannot afford to send a laptop to New York (do y'all know how much that would cost? I can't do it, I'm struggling to get by right now). They got rude with me, saying that they won't cover the costs because I'm past my one year after sales period, even though I'm not? Then proceeded to tell me I agreed to a partial refund when I was never offered a refund nor did I agree to one, because I wasn't offered one? Even if I had been, I'm not agreeing to a partial refund for something I paid $310 for and haven't even had a year only for it be messing up already.",

You can use the one type C port to charge your other equipment and connect other equipment within the laptop it works great. Just make sure when you run all the programs on the system that you update all the drivers especially network drivers. And its true you do feel an electrical shock wow the laptop is connected to the plug. However its warning you that the PC is consuming a lot of energy. If you plan to have your laptop always connected. My recommendation is to open up the laptop which is pretty easy and disconnect the battery. Theres no point to mess up something that works so great right now. The battery charge lasts about two hours and 45 minutes. Processing speed is what you get for for the amount that you are paying. I do enjoy this laptop recommend it to anyone that is on a budget. BTW works wonders for students !",
