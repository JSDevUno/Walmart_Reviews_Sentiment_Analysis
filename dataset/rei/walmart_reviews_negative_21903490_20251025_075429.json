Secondly they've been attached to my shelves undisturbed. and they literally have just broken. The clips have literally just broke. They are never moved, touched or anything. I just finally realized that my plants weren't moving and then I felt them and there was no air coming out of them. And then they have just fallen off my shelves. The clips just snap and fall off.
