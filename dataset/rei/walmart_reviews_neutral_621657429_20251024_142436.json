      "review_text": "They have either changed the way they make these since the first pack of crew socks I bought, or these are not the same style as those. Either way, they're otherwise what I was looking for. Durable soft socks with \"padded\" soles that, to a point, actually \"massage\" your feet. Very comfortable. So, unless I find some other ones, still Hanes of course, I will likely buy more of these in the future. However, I WILL NEVER order directly from Hanes.com again. It seems their left hand doesn't know what the right one is doing. First, my package ships and I get an email about it, but NO tracking info. So, I have to contact them about it and, lo and behold, not 2 days later my package arrives. Finally, A MONTH later, they send me tracking info that leads to UPS where it tells me my package has been delivered. And, here's the kicker, after that same months time, they finally took their payment from my checking account. If not for that, I probably would have given 5 stars. As it is, the product is carrying 3 stars now and the service 1.",
