The bar was covered with a cardboard tube in the center that only went about two-thirds the length of the bar. The bar's bare metal was exposed and the bubble wrap on the ends was worn through from scraping on the ground during shipping. Hopefully the replacement will be packed better! I'll post a new review of the replacement.",

A simple shake and they fell out so the kid who made it in China is slacking. They spin freely (supposed to) and squeak as they do. Slightly annoying but it works. If you don't want a bar that might squeak then buy one with bearings. Knurling is good.",
