So, after that Corsair died, this was a no brainer replacement. And for such a cheap price, it's a legitimate bang for your buck for whatever sort of gaming stuff you want to do. While not a hardcore audiophile piece of equipment, this headset gets the job done in spades for a fraction of the price of more premium kits. Just be careful with the volume control, cause this thing can get very loud.",

I have a habit of pushing one side of the headset off so I have an ear exposed, this headset is very very bulky and for the first few minutes it is comfortable but after that it starts to kind of hurt. If you wear the headsets normally they might end up working fine for you but if you like to have one ear exposed they definitely are too bulky for that.
