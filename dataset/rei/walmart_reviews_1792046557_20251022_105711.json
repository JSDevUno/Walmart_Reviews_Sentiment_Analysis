The range, however, is a bit disappointing as I lose signal in the next room over in my house. Bluetooth headsets will do you much better if range is a concern. Ergonomically these are also great. Very light and they don't make my hears hurt like many other over-the-ear headphones.",

It uses a suspension band instead of sliding ear cups, and the band only has two possible positions. Plus earcups are stationary and do not rotate. -Sound quality. Unbalanced and very slightly muffled. Other features tend to fall to preference wuch as wired vs wireless or mesh vs leatherette ear cups. So overall, functions as a wireless headset, but I much prefer the wired G432 for its better sound quality and adjustablity.",

      "review_text": "I would've rated this 5 stars but I have a few concerns/issues regarding this headset and I'm hoping the manufacturer/merchant sees this review and offers help. My first concern is that there were no written instructions or any kind of paperwork/manual in the box; it just contained the headset with the headband, USB receiver and the charging cord, no user documentation as it states on the box. My second concern is that when I am using the headset for work (windows 11 PC) it works great for the most part but my mic is muted even though it is flipped down. Now this is an intermittent issue but a critical issue as I am an inbound call center rep and the issue has occurred at the beginning of receiving a call. I use it with the avaya software as well as Microsoft teams, my mic gets muted when flipped down regardless of the software I'm using at the time. The only “fix” I have found is to flip the mic back up, wait a second and then flip it back down and it'll then unmute. Other than these 2 concerns, the headset is super comfortable - I wear glasses and rarely feel discomfort, it has great audio quality and noise cancellation for both the mic and earpieces. I really like this headset, I can see myself using it for a long time; I just need to find a way to fix the mic muting issue!",

      "title": "So far the best gaming headset I have right now!",
      "review_text": "I'll try something new with my review format and try to \"categorize\" things to make this more readable. Audio: The audio is good for a \"gaming headset\". I say this because headphones made by gaming companies don't offer superior audio compared to headsets made by actual audio companies. But the audio in these are great. Good enough bass, EQ, volume, etc. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but unless you're downgrading from an expensive set, you should be satisfied with the sound quality of these. Controls: The controls are great and straightforward. You have a volume dial on the side and an adjustable microphone. The volume dial is great in that it changes the volume on the device you're connected to, not the volume of the headset itself. This means you don't have two different volumes on both the device and the headphones, you just have one single volume. This is great for convenience, as it means no more fiddling with my Windows volume and headphones volume, it's all set to just one single volume. Build quality: In order to achieve its lightweightness, it had to use materials that are also light as well. This means it will feel \"cheap\", like a \"toy\". But it's because of the light plastic and build design. So I can get why people may see it this way, but it personally feels just fine to me. It feels sturdy enough that I don't mind it. And when it comes to it, you really have only two options: Lighter headset, but less premium feel, or heavier headset, but more premium feel. In this case, I prefer a headset that doesn't weigh much, so I'm willing to accept the build quality. The straps and ear cushions feel great as well, and are quite soft without being too soft or too firm. Microphone: The microphone has a great feature where if you put it up, it auto disables itself, and vice versa. The quality is... Not great. If you want professional quality and sound, get an actual standalone mic. Most headset mics, regardless of company, will sound subpar in comparison. But if you don't mind that, then this will suffice. The communication is clear enough in my opinion, and teammates will be able to easily hear you without too much noise or diminished quality. Wireless aspect: It uses a USB. This is an upside and a downside. The upside: You get way less latency. The downside: You don't get Bluetooth. So if your desired device won't take USB, then you basically can't use these with them. Battery life: Lasts me a good amount of time. I can go days without charging it, and I use it a lot daily for videos, music, etc. at around 75% volume. It also has a battery saving feature where it can auto shutoff when it detects it's not in use, which is pretty neat. Overall: Great if you want a light, wireless headset from a reputable brand and don't mind any of the minor downsides that come with it. I recommend purchasing if it's in your budget and you are interested at this point.",

Normally this is something I would let go, but I'm confused about why they came out of the box, is HANDWRITTEN as \"new headphones\" but says \"G353-White-Restored\" on the packing slip.
