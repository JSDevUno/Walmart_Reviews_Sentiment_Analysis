It has 2 speeds - high and low which both of them are extremely quiet so no one around me hears the fan on. It is adjustable moving it up and down as needed for the direction you want. It has a stand, not a clip fan, this is very sturdy and does not shake at all. I ordered it online through Walmart app and it arrived a few days later. Very satisfied with this fan! I recommend it!",

Would prefer a rotary speed/off select than the slide switch. Like it can be pointed downward since it sits on an above shelf to blow downward. Does not oscillate, but I already knew that, and don't need it for where it is used. Would like the fan blade cage to be easier to separate for dusting (have to use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the halves apart to get inside to dust the blades). I had one before, and this was a replacement. After near 4 years, the old one's motor bearing were getting noisy. Note: The fan blades are simply pressed onto the motor spindle, so friction holds the blades to the spindle. When pointed straight down, the blades will gradually slide off the spindle which will have the blades bang against the cage. Used hot-melt glue to affix blades to spindle.",

It's not a super strong breeze that blows out but it's just enough for us. It's really quiet and I like that about it too. I like that it's not battery operated so I don't have to change or charge anything to get it to work. My kids keep grabbing and it playing with it and they haven't broken it yet so that's also a good sign.

      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This 6-inch portable fan is perfect for keeping the air flowing when I'm working at my desk that is in a corner of our living area where the air flow from the ceiling fan doesn't quite reach. The fan comes in two pieces but is very easy to assemble with just one screw. The fan is adjustable to put the air flow exactly where it is needed. It has 2 speeds but the low speed is perfect for what I need & it provides comfort without blowing everything off of the desk. It is quiet & doesn't vibrate on the desktop plus it is not top-heavy so I don't worry about it tipping over. I am very happy with this desk fan & it is exactly what I needed to stay comfortable while working.",
