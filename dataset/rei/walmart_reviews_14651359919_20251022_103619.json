      "review_text": "[PT-BR] Gostaria de deixar aqui registrado minha total INDIGNAÇÃO com a WD. Não imaginei que passaria por isso com esta Marca! Comprei um WD Black de 2TB no final de Fevereiro (02/24), chegou no início de Março (03/02). O Hd começou apresentar ruídos estranhos. Quando verifiquei no \"crystaldiskinfo\" o hd em 30 dias de uso tinha desligado e ligado mais de 531 vezes (04/05)!!! Sendo que um ssd que tenho desde 2018 foi ligado e desligado 331 vezes (04/05)! Depois de 24h de testes de 531 vezes subiu para 773 vezes (04/06)! Entrei em contato três vezes no chat online da WD para tirar dúvidas. Abri um RMA, arquei os custos de frete e enviei para a garantia da WD. Após, a WD enviou-me um HD de troca. Pois bem, o HD apresentou o mesmo problema - em 24h esse HD de troca foi ligado e desligado 103 vezes no crystaldiskinfo (04/27), ou seja o mesmo idêntico problema e mesmo ruído! O HD fica reebotando toda hora! Fiz vários testes dentro do que consegui. Tirei fotos, gravei vídeos, tirei capturas de tela - Isso desde o primeiro HD. Para deixar tudo muito bem registrado da forma mais transparente o possível. Entrei em contato novamente no chat online e expliquei tudo direitinho. Falaram que não podiam dar reembolso. Quem deveria dar era o vendedor. Aí eu questionei: \"Como eu irei solicitar reembolso para quem vendeu o HD, se o HD que foi-me vendido foi devolvido para a Garantia da WD, sendo enviado-me um outro diferente do primeiro com nota fiscal da WD?\" O HD parou de ser reconhecido pelo Windows, tal como o primeiro. Tirei 6 prints(capturas de tela) demonstrando que o HD, de fato, parou de ser reconhecido. Todos os prints eu deixei a tela inteira - sem edição. Entrei em contato novamente no dia 04/27. Fiz tudo que estava ao meu alcance. Deixei tudo documentado. Como não obstante, tive uma resposta que deixou-me indignadissímo. Pois, já havia explicado que o HD tinha parado de ser reconhecido externamente e internamente, desde (04/28). Quando foi (05/06) responderam-me para eu enviar capturas de tela para comprovar que o HD tinha parado mesmo de ser reconhecido SENDO QUE EU JÁ TINHA ENVIADO ISSO NO DIA 04/27 E 04/28. Está sendo uma surpresa para mim passar por isso. Não esperava que os WD Black estivessem dando tantos problemas assim e que o atendimento deixava tanto a desejar. Estou no aguardo de uma tratativa e possibilidade de reembolso.",
