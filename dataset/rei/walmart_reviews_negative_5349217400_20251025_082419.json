      "review_text": "Desktop computer tower arrived broken and screws rattling around on the inside of tower. Pieces were broken off of something plastic and roaming around inside the box. The monitor is split at the bottom and coming apart, I can hear the screen kinda rolling around inside the monitor case, rattling around in there. The monitor base will not attach to the monitor because there was a middle screw piece that was broken off! The monitor was an Acer monitor, not sure if that matters. I didn't even bother plugging it in at this point, because what's the point?! I purchased the extra 4 year warranty, and much to my surprise, it states there's a 19 day waiting period before I can even use it and then it states that my warranty doesn't even begin until July 02, 2025! So, using the warranty that I purchased to get a fixed/different computer is WORTHLESS! I just threw away money, basically.",

      "review_text": "there was a washer sticking out of the top of the display case. the top 1\" of the display flickered. the machine was not properly cleaned of the old software, so win11 tried to load, it kept failing. 89$ for tech support that claimed installation was a complete lie. Since win11 could not load,it could not connect to the internet. and tech support says if they can't get to the machine to load the remote control app, then they have no responsibility to refund me any money. The customer service desk had me sitting on the floor for 20 minutes until they could figure out how to do a return. they woman at the desk was completely untrained. and the MGR. was impolite and disrespectful. His attitude was that i was an idiot. He claimed the packaging was not walmarts...no it wasn't. It was from walmarts reuilder vendor which i had to show him using packing label on the box, duh. I paid 425$~ and got promised a refund of 353.00~ when the vendor determines I can have one...This is the worst experience i have ever had with Walmart. I will sue you for the return. not kidding. money's not important my pound of flesh is. you took 2 days of my time and was lied to, both in person and over the phone. your add was a lie, concerning tech support. what a rip-off.",
