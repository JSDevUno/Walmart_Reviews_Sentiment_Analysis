It has three speeds and can sit on a table-top or be hung from a hook. I also like that it runs off USB or 4 AA batteries for easy mobility. A friend of mind had this and I had to have one. Also purchased one as a future gift for someone. LOVE IT!!!",

Perfect fan for standing up or putting on items to keep two people comfortable with air ventilation in high speed. Only complaint, I ordered two, took seven days to find out, there was a problem, will only receive one. Still happy to get one, but disappointed in Walmart's accountability for available. Definitely grade this portable fan a 10. Will wait next year to get one more. Compactible to carry with me on motorcycle trips staying overnight in hotels.",

      "review_text": "The settings blow out nice cool air, even on low. I bought this for my mama to use by her bed at night as she has occasional hot flashes and this is much easier than getting up out of bed to turn on the ceiling fan, with this she can cut on and off and adjust as needed. I like the sturdiness of the stand, no worries with it falling back or over. It stays in place exactly how you adjust it. I also like how the power button is in the front. The one I have has the power in the back and have to turn it over to power on. With this option, makes it much easier to turn off and on while in bed and go right back to sleep üò¥ üí§! Also, the usb plug comes with the wall outlet plug and I have even used the usb plug without the wall plug, in my computer and the fan came right on! You can also use 4 AA batteries to use on the go. Not sure how long it would last on the batteries but definitely a good option to use if needed while out and about. For $14, this is definitely more than what we expected and hope it lasts a good long while. The only thing I dont like is that sometimes the power cord comes out just slightly, just barely out of the socket so you have to make sure it is all the way pushed in or else it will not power on. The first time using, we thought it was malfunctioning, but since we discovered that it has to be all the way in, I mean like no space whatsoever in between lol, it comes right on!",

The necklace fans are great because they're rechargeable, but that's only good for mom. because I can't get the angle right to put it in the stroller. it's dangerous for a baby to be around strings.

It runs on 4 AA batteries or you can use the USB ac adapter. I love that it has 3 different speed settings. Even on the lowest it gives a nice little breeze. I recommend this for anyone with a baby or small children when you go anywhere outside in the heat. It works a lot better than the smaller stroller fans.",

      "review_text": "The Mainstays On-The-Go Folding Fan in white has many great features. The folding handle is also the stand and the hanger. So you can carry it, hang it or stand it. The Mainstays On-The-Go Folding Fan is multi-powered and runs on 4 AA batteries or a USB power cord with an AC plug-in adapter. The USB port in on the back of the fan above the battery compartment.The Mainstays On-The-Go Folding Fan has a 3.5 inch diameter blade which is actually fairly quiet and powerful. The USB power cord is 59 inches long which gives you more maneuverability to place the fan where you need it most. The On-The-Go Folding Fan can be taken anywhere. I do not know how long the batteries will last (# of hours on different speeds)but with the USB power cord and a portable/or solar power bank you can have unlimited power. Unfortunately the USB does not charge the batteries. The Mainstays On-the-Go Folding Fan is great as a personal fan, work station fan or for camping, setting on the pic-nic table, using to cool the tent in the evening etc. The On-The-Go Folding Fan is small enough to fit in a purse or backpack yet powerful enough to have 3 speeds. The blue lighted ring around the power button gets brighter with each speed. The Mainstays On the Go Folding fan is extremely portable, but it's the best mini fan I have seen on the market. An awesome Mother's Day/Father's Day gift. Perfect for anyone any day.",

I can't say about how long it will last, but I love that it is a small & can pack in my bag without taking much space and light. Save the box to put it away for road trips I wouldn't use this as a daily use fan to go to sleep with. I would buy this again even thinking of buying this for some Christmas stocking stuffers.

Sits on a moveable handle that can go completely flat if needed. 3 power settings that are shown by a small blue circle led light on the front.

      "title": "Great fan for the desk or for traveling",
      "review_text": "There's a lot to like about this little fan. I'll start with the positives. First, I love that it can be powered with a USB. This makes it so versatile. With nearly every small device being powered with USB in today's world, that makes this fan able to be powered in the home, vehicles, campers, etc. You could even power it with a portable USB power bank (see pic), making it very travel or camping friendly. Second, you're also able to power it with 4 AA batteries, which makes it versatile (not recommended, see below). Other positives include the portable size, the light weight design, and the stand is adjustable and stiff, meaning, you can alter the angle or direction of the fan. Now the negatives. First, using AA batteries does not last very long. I used AC Delco batteries (not the best, but still good quality batteries), and the fan lasted about 3 hours when on full. Second, there are 3 speeds, however, the first speed seems to hardly move the air. You need your face to be right next to the fan to feel the moving air. I can't really think of many uses for having the fan on the lowest setting. The fan is small enough that you almost always need it on the highest speed to be effective. Overall, I would recommend this fan. If you're a traveler, enjoy camping (in either the tent or camper), or need a little desk fan while you work, this is perfect for you. Just make sure you can power it via the USB rather than AA batteries, otherwise you'll burn through batteries quick.",

Great for a work desk to blow the air where you need it and not blow papers around. The 3 speed options are great, I have used all 3 at different times.

Since it had to fit into my backpack the replacement fan had to be small enough and lightweight enough to fit into my backpack. Which this one did. Granted I bought this on a Saturday and I am writting this on a Sunday so I havent had a chance to test it at work but so far it seems to be powerful enough to work the way I need it to. But thank goodness I tested this at home before trying it at work. Since it will only work if you have it either plugged into an power source or if you have AA batteries in it. If I hadnt tested it at home first I would not have known this and therefore I would not have had the AA batteries in it when I went to work. Nor would I have had the cord and or piece to plug it into an electrical socket. As I work in a large warhouse that is hard to air condition having a little fan like this one is sometimes the only thing that helps to get me though the day. I am still debating about returning this and getting my money back.",
