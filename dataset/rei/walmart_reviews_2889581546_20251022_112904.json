HOWEVER i had to order the phone to be delivered, why twice. because the st croix falls Wisconsin store didnt scan the phone before delivery it. so when i was trying to hook it up with straight talk they said i was never scanded at the store. in other words . it would happen to people that steal the phones . when ordered the 2nd phone i called them and ask for them to make sure the phone gets scanned this time. the response i got from the woman was. oh it was scanned properly we always do. i told her no it wasnt. and then said well please just make sure it is this time. and it wasn't .. im disabled that's why i have stuff delivered. not any more",

Paid for just the least expensive plan which did come with data. However, she had Wi-Fi in her home so she was running off Wi-Fi majority of the time for some reason she could not access social medias at all she could not send or receive pictures at all even with their least expensive plan it should've allowed this I called and double checked with the company they said it should, and for some reason it would not work at all. Their customer service was terrible as with most companies their customer service is based out of another country which is fine however, she couldn't even reach them at all. Every time she tried to call I would have to call from my phone she could not use 611 nor could she call their 800 number I do not recommend straight talk at all nor do I recommend this phone. Worst purchase I've made in a long time save your money it's a waste..",

      "title": "Not Bad For An Entry Level Phone",
      "review_text": "Overall, it is a decent phone for an entry level budget phone. Some pros and cons about the phone: Pros 1. I like the size and weight of the phone. Yes, it is made of plastic and not feeling premium. But the biggest advantage is that it is light. I don't feel tired of holding the phone for a long period of time. I also like the aspect ratio of the phone. It is not too tall nor wide. Yes it has side screen bezel, but that doesn't bother me too much. I think the size is about right. 2. It's an android without too much add-ons. Pretty close to the original stock android. 3. It has a headphone jack! 4. As long as not running intensive apps, phone temperature is not bad. Cons: 1. It's a budget phone. Can't expect too much performance. Basical tasks such as web browsing, youtubing and messaging via text app will get the jobs done. But any heavy intensive apps will slow down the phone quite a bit and it just lag. 2. The speaker is on the back of the phone and if it is covered up with finger, no sound. So if you lay it down on a flat surface (without a case), you basically can't hear much. With a case, the phone is lifted up a little and the sound is not that bad. 3. Have a review unit and the phone is locked with a specific carrier, can't really test out call quality. During the initial set up. some random apps just keep installing. But after initial setup, no more. So so: 1. The camera is so so. Again, can't expect too much from an entry level phone. It takes pictures, but can't compare the quality to a premium phone. 2. The battery is okay. I think as long as you don't do too much heavy liftings, the battery can last. Standby overnight battery drain is not bad. Things I wish this phone has: 1. In the gesture setting, I wish it has the function to turn on display when the phone is lifted or double tap to awake. Without the function, the only way to wake up the phone is by pressing power button. 2. I wish they change the position of power and volume buttons. Currently, volume buttons are located on the top and power is below it. It takes some time to get used to. Overall, if you are looking for a budget entry level phone. I think it gets job done. Just don't expect too much performance. It is good for basic tasking.",

      "review_text": "The C110 combines the physical features of Samsung Galaxy and Iphones, -square-straight all the way around but on the screen edge. But unlike those two, the C110 is light and slightly slimmer, which makes handle and use easier. The back is uniquely Nokia, -scratch-resistant texture and the good-idea speaker slit on the lower-left corner for better output and reception. It's 9/10 user-friendly, providing logical positioning of the home, back and stop buttons, -much better than the Iphone, Samsung and Google Pixel (my current favorite), Start-up had no issues and copying everything from my current had zero glitches. It has only one camera but pixel at 13megap is more than enough that an average person ever uses but the image, though good, is not impressive. The magnification range adjuster comes up when the image is zoomed, and is a smoother option than the tap-choose option on other phones. Video sound is crisp but faint. Sound recording needs to be improved to allow volume increase after recording. Nevertheless, it has enough user-adjustable features and enough options for quick editing and enhancement, Overall, the C110 is a very good phone to have, but needs a big only-on-Nokia identifiable feature, which I was expecting but did not see or feel.",

It can run multiple apps at the same time but I would still recommend closing background tasks otherwise the vram and processor has issues keeping up. It is only 4G compatible which was also a let down but as long as it still gets support for the operating system its a fair price",
