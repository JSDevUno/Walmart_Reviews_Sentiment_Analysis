Their budget phones under 100 bucks are getting worse every year. Unfortunately this Samsung has not exactly blew me away. Its slow. When I'm out of the house I use ATT service. Its always been a bit slow but...this phone is taking over 2 minutes to open an app. At home using the wifi it even drags.Trying to type this review the phone cut off twice. I can't believe that people like this piece of sh%23t. Its too bad because Samsung makes good budget phones. Or they used to.Now they make 5000 dollar televisions.

Plus, I live forty five minutes away from the nearest Walmart in order to contact them to clear this phone out of their system. I am little irritated and annoyed that this crucial step was not executed before my phone left the facility. Now, I am trying to figure out a way to get through the busy signal of the phone system before I leave on this journey to see if my phone can get cleared out of the Walmart system. To top matters off my printer is not working and I have no phone or internet service in order to send a simple email to myself to prove the purchase of the phone. I do feel aggravated about this although I know that we all make mistakes therefore I am giving four stars considering the phone is brand new and it was likely an honest mistake however it is very inconvenient mistake at this time. I have to do this today because time is not on my side at the moment. I will leave it at that!!!",

There isn't even a screen protector on it, so absolutely nothing is touching it. Google Maps started scrolling to the left endlessly and then jittering. Spotify randomly restarted, started at the first song of the queue, and turned volume to max despite closing the app a few minutes before and muting my phone. Really inconvenient in the middle of a lecture. As soon as I took my finger off the volume button, it turned back up. I kept trying to bring up volume controls on the screen to mute it, and it disappeared as soon as I opened it. I had to hold the volume button down and shut down the phone. It's also full of apps that can't be uninstalled, namely a number of Samsung and Google apps. I don't need both Chrome and the Samsung Internet app, but I can't uninstall either of them. I'd rather use a different GPS app, but I can't uninstall Maps. My phone is nearly out of space, and I can't get rid of the apps wasting space. The phone is also incredibly slow.
