      "review_text": "This monitor appears nice on the outside, as it is asthetically pleasing, however, once you get on the inside, nothing but disappointment lurks. This is one of those times where the old saying \"you get what you pay for\" comes into play. There is one, and only one, button on this whole screen and it is a toggle like a joystick that you would find on a game controller. Using this toggle is clunky and awkward, especially with your arm around the screen. Toggling through available selections and selecting something to change is a nightmare all in it's own. This wouldn't be such a big deal if I was only using one input but I often switch between the two and the functionality just ins't there. It's stupid, to say the least. My favorite part is that sometimes when switching between inputs, nothing happens, and you have to unplug the cable you're not trying to use. Lucikly my desk is set up in a way that I can get to the back of it easily, but I shouldn't have to. Aside from input control, the on screen text leaves something to be disired - the font looks...pixelated? I don't know how to explain it other than to say it is NOT clear. If it wasn't for the size of the screen, I would have trouble reading. I have not used this monitor for gaming, so I can't speak to that, but I have used it for streaming which is just o.k. The blacks aren't very deep and the colors are so so. I am using this as a second monitor to a Dell laptop and the Dell is crystal clear for comparison. Overall, this just wasn't a good purchase, and you can order the same monitor from Temu, if that tells you anything.",

The description says 100hz which is true once you connect it to a tower and change the settings to max it out ... comes set at 60hz which caused me to freak out at first but once adjusted imaging is as wanted. Front of box also had deep puncture in middle of the screen which thankfully the Styrofoam packing saved the monitor from being damaged.",

All in all I would rank it a 10 out of 10 and don't have any complaints EXCEPT that two weeks in, one of the pixels has blown out. Right in the middle of the screen. Unfortunately, I was not given the option to exchange it as I would be willing to give this monitor another chance so back to Walmart it goes.

Easy on the eyes and makes my games look great. Time and again, this monitor has made my sessions a million times easier and I can see everything better. I've even proven to see other things better than my friends because of it. Instead of a bunch of different buttons for settings, there is only the singular one, which doubles as the power and a joystick to help with setting selection so you don't have to keep looking for each thing. Definitely happy I picked this one, and will be recommending to my friends.",

I was scared that I couldn't do anything without a pc or anything. Your sure can this product the only down side I would say about it is the sound quality. I'm happy it comes with built in speakers.
