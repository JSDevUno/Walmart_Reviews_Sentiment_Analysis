I don't believe they want to refund my money and count on me giving up. AT even $20 a pop times thousands of 20's add up to one heck of a profit per day. Even if they do return your money in 10 days, how much profit did they make in interest off of your money.",

As long as my phone is on the pad, it gets charged. The cord is able to removed from the pad which makes it great to pack up and travel with! I like the black color since it is touched constantly. I also like that it can be used for iPhones or androids, so friends can throw their phone on to charge as well if needed.
