      "review_text": "I honestly usually avoid pricey headsets and ussually get more affordable options but I was recommended by a local walmart associcate get a more expensive option than usual. I had asked as i was having issues with headsets constantly going out. i usual experience problems quickly with areas: the mic, the sound (going out), and the headset coming failing. I was explained that this is mostly likely due to the lower priced items not being meant for repeated long play sessions. So far it doing well. it also have great spacial sound quality and pickup sound well. i very much like that you can adjust your mic volume individually from the overall sound volume. It is also very comfortable. i usuall think headset make my ears sore but not this one. its adjustable and the over ear area swivels so it feels like it conform to my head comfortably for use.",

      "title": "Great Sound, Super Easy Bluetooth Switching",
      "review_text": "This Corsair gaming headset has quickly become my go-to for both gaming and everyday use. The audio quality is seriously impressive – rich, immersive sound with strong bass and crisp detail that makes games and music sound awesome. One of my favorite features is how easy it is to switch between Bluetooth devices. Whether I'm jumping from my PS5 to my phone or even my iPad, the transition is smooth and hassle-free. It's super convenient and makes the headset feel really versatile. The comfort level is also great – lightweight with cushy ear cups that hold up well during long sessions. The only small downside is the mic. It works, but sometimes it doesn't pick up my voice very clearly unless I adjust the boom or speak a little louder. Not a huge issue, but something to be aware of if clear voice chat is a priority. All in all, it's an awesome headset with great sound, comfort, and versatility. Just a slight mark off for the mic, but still highly recommended!",

      "review_text": "Corsair is known for quality electronics, I can't complain about the sound,as it is good on these headphones. What I don't like, and is a problem on every use, is that I have no idea if the microphone is on or not unless I test it with Windows audio recorder or ask my colleagues, \"can you hear me?\" There is a button to turn it on or off, or it shuts off when the microphone is in the lift position; but there is no indicator of when it is on or off. They put colored lights to indicate whether the headphones were reading from Bluetooth or from the USB dongle, can they put one on to say if the microphone is on or not? Very annoying!",

Additionally, the head band is cracked in two places, making the headset fit extremely loosely. I most definitely do NOT recommend getting these, as I've had these for far too long, and have had enough.",

I just picked up a logitech headset and it is significantly better than this one in every regard. This goes for $100 and I got it on sale for $80, but frankly it has the build quality of a $20 headset.",

To start with the headset is fairly uncomfortable to wear, my next issue is the headset is prone to adjusting my input volume for some reason which an issue ive never had with another headset. It lowers the overall volume at which people hear me to such a low point that they cant hear me until i go back into the setting and fix it. Another issue is that on occasion the headset will “jam comms” as my buddy calls it, in which it apparently messes with the audio increasing my volume exponentially and will completely and utterly garble any word that comes out of my mouth until i reset the headset and replug in the dongle. When i attempted to use bluetooth the audio was atrocious and sounded worse than an xbox 360 headset from over a decade ago. Audio is fine when using the dongle besides the previously stated issues. As well, on the application for it on my pc it doesnt allow me to adjust it in any way shape or form. I cannot recommend this product without lying.",

I do love mostly everything about them. The sound quality is great and they really do block out any distraction. my only gripes about the headset is about the microphone. The rigidity of the microphone as well as its length and placement are very awkward for me. I have to feel around each time I want to put it back down and because its so short, there are times when in the midst of gaming that I realize I can't tell if the microphone is down or in the up-mute position. a minor gripe, though. i love that the headset lets you know with an audible beep that it has muted itself. It also lacks an annoying constant beep that me old headset had that would happen when it was low on battery. There doesn't appear to be much indication of low battery (not as of yet), but if there is, its at least not aggravating.",

Problem is, it does absolutely NOTHING for this hardware. Like.. Zero. Nothing. At all. Second, for $100 I kinda expect my headset to stay in one piece for longer than 6 months. Not the case here. (*NOTE* I am particularly careful with electronics, and have taken good care of this headset...) First problem was one of the earpads just kinda fell off. Didn't pop off or give any indication of an issue, just fell off while I was pulling them off of my head. So, I bought new ones. Not a huge deal, but I'd rather not have to have spent that $20. Next, a month or so later, one of the little covers just above the ear piece (kinda triangular, it covers wires and such) also just... fell off. While the headset was being worn, just sitting listening to a video. *plonk* - Right on top of my head, then down onto my shirt and off to the floor. This is all just very poor craftmanship. But hey, after supergluing the little cover back on, it hasn't fallen off again, so there's that, I guess...",
