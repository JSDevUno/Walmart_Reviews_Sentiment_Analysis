The key is the direction (up or down) each shelf faces. We put it together originally so that there would be a lip on each level..not allowing things to fall off. That's the wrong way. there's a locking mechanism when placed the other way that assures strength! If I buy another, it will go in my living room. It's elegant enough to be right in front of my window and hold my plants!",

I have others of this style and they are very sturdy, can hold a 250 lb person per shelf. this one cannot. also the depth is closer to 13 inches than 12. I was expecting under 12.",
