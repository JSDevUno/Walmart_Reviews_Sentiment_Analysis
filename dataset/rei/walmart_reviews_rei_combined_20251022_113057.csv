I really did. I'd previously owned two sets of X08's, one failed (one earpiece broke), the other set's going strong. So I do appreciate the VEATOOL brand and their reliable/affordable set of products When I seen these, I thought 'oh this must be the next new thing'. Touch screen, etc. Lets start with some of the more obvious flaws. 1. Frequently disconnects - also very easy to de-pair with the other headset and give you that wonky out of phase audio feeling. 2. Charge lasts about an hour. Makes me think that something's constantly trying to pair or work harder than it needs to, to maintain a connection. I've disabled noise cancelling and graphic equalization. Still doesn't last longer. 3. The textured coating on the earpieces (while nice) can become quite slick and leave you fumbling and accidentally touch the controls on the earpiece when you didn't intend to , cutting off a call or other. 4. Touch screen on case. Nice idea but it is fiddly. Doesn't work well with big thumbs. If you want a basic but reliable model, try the X08. Good battery life, wireless charging and average noise cancelling. I will try other models in their lineup in the future, but I think these ones need some TLC from VEATOOL before they're ready for prime-time.",,False,0

I use them at work where there are a lot of machines around me and they work great w/o interference. The only problem I had was that the charging cord that came with the earbuds did not work.

This seller is dishonest and scamming people. They've submitted hundreds of AI generated reviews, giving their faulty/defective products 5 stars. I totally fell for it too. I didn't read any of the individual reviews before purchasing. I saw “flash deal” $18.99 product usually worth (supposedly) $90, I saw a rating of 4.5 out of 1,400 reviews, and I read the summary of reviews generated by Walmart's AI bot, that said “customers rave about this product and how amazing it is..” etc, etc, etc. So of course I thought I hit the jackpot by finding these ear buds at this price, so I immediately bought 2 pair. (One black case and one with a pink case) After receiving them, I was actually pleasantly surprised with the packaging and nice look and feel of the case and ear buds. I liked that it had a display screen to always show the battery level of the case and each ear bud. They were really easy to pair with my Apple TV. BUT- when I started watching my show while using them… they were pausing and unpausing my show every few seconds, and completely disconnecting and reconnecting every 30 seconds or so. I'm not even exaggerating. It's so bad that these are completely unusable. I thought maybe the first pair was defective so I opened the second pair and they had the same issues. After all this, I decided to go read some of the hundreds of 5 star reviews. It was obvious that every single 5 star review is fake, AI generated reviews. All of the reviews and very similar in wording and length. Some of the reviews are just complete copies of other ones. All of the 5 star reviews are too perfect. Real people make typing errors, grammar and punctuation errors, spelling errors, and use abbreviations and/or slang. Just read thru a handful of them and you'll see what I mean.

I was aware of the missing input, and I've had to utilise the front socket. However, I was misled about the optical drive. I had asked the sales support if an optical drive was fitted, and I understood it was. It isn't. It may well be possible to fit one later, but that's not the point. Also, I've mixed feelings about HP Wolf Security. Having read a lot of reviews I'm in two minds whether to replace with my trusted alternative.

Beginning with packaging and a nod to sustainability, I love the simple cardboard recyclable box - I appreciate this more than having an elaborate and wasteful unboxing experience. Keep the cost lower, keep it simple - love it. The hardware itself has ocean-bound plastics and recycled aspects in it. Also, well done HP. This is exactly right - keep on this, we care! The power supply as a side note, had a great wrap around the cord - something that gave it a bit more personality and a nicer aesthetic. I appreciated this, though would never have expected it - but I like it! This originally had Windows 10 Pro on it, but upgraded to Windows 11 without issue swiftly with the updating process - my preference as well to be on 11. The machine is zippy, it handled multiple apps open, HD video playback and some intense computational tasks (lots of spreadsheet work) simultaneously - I did not notice any lag or the hardware skipping a beat. The keyboard is indeed quiet, much quieter than a few other large name brands I have, and the feel was soft to the touch. The trackpad was large, and responsive - sensitive almost and I had to dial it back a bit for my tastes (which are fully customizable). There is a built-in Tile feature, which I didn't seek out specifically, but it is interesting to have and has come in handy once already. Who knew, I would misplace my laptop. Camera quality is good, best in plenty of light - low light you can see the grain and artifacts pop up - so proper lighting setup applies here for those late night video calls or low-light conditions. Audio is bonkers. The B&O's do justice on web playback and streaming - really not bad for a laptop, and they grow on you for sure. The machine is a little heavier than I would have thought, not an issue, but I did notice it picking it up for the first time -it doesn't come to mind now but was one of those first impression items. The body is seems predominantly metal, durable and has held up - with some plastic (display case looks to be). Keyboard backlighting is good, helps in low light conditions as well but is not overbearing. I also enjoy having the fingerprint scanner - I'm not a fan of face recognition (which it can also do) so this is a great alternative for me. In all, its a very fast, powerhouse of a machine with very forward thinking capability. It will last me a considerable amount of time without replacement. Very happy with it, go HP on this one!",,False,0

It comes with options that I would want (i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, Nvida T550 GPU) and is crazy fast. It's not as common to have a dedicated GPU in most laptops now, but I highly recommend it if you'll be doing anything creative with photo/video/design/etc and this one does not disappoint. My biggest surprises so far are how much I like the fingerprint scanner (seriously, it makes logging in feel easier than unlocking my phone) and how great the screen is. Colors are fantastic, the display is very sharp, and the viewing angle has to be close to 180 degrees. I have a work laptop (different major brand) that is meant to be at a similar level but I didn't realize how disappointing the screen was until I started using this one. A slightly different approach with this laptop is to use 1920x1200 instead of 1920x1080. It feels the same which is good, but also gives more space vertically for all the toolbars at the top of programs which can take up way too much space on a laptop screen. I am also shocked at how good the speakers are, I love audio and have a fantastic home theater setup...which this doesn't compare to and I wouldn't expect it to. But I've never heard laptop speakers this good before where it's not painful to listen to music like it's in a tin can, these (separate right/left speakers) are enjoyable and can get plenty loud! I'm not sure how much of a difference the Wolf Pro Security will make but I guess time will tell. Having a Tile built in is a great idea and really enhances the physical security. It's slightly heavier than I was expecting but it's really not bad at all, it feels sturdy which I'd much rather have than something light and flimsy. The camera is sharp in bright light but pretty grainy in dim lighting (common on every laptop I've used), but I do appreciate the built-in camera cover that you can slide over.  The computer was quick to set up, connected flawlessly with my wireless HP printer in a few seconds, and it also connected right away with my dock (from a different brand) and could handle the laptop screen plus two other independent external monitors (I love USB-C docks and being able to connect everything with 1 cord including charging it). Speaking of cords, the power cord that comes with it is really cool, almost like a cloth feel instead of the usual plastic/rubber that every other laptop cord I've ever used has felt like...just a nice unexpected bonus! I work in software development, have had jobs in graphic design, video and photo editing, and worked in technical support/helpdesk environments for years so I'm pretty picky...but I can't say enough good things about this computer! I've used plenty of other brands in the last few years and hadn't really thought of HP as a major contender for a high-end laptop but this ZBook has absolutely changed my mind!",,False,0

I used the ac adapter to get the power supply and set the power settings so that the screen would not disappear or the computer would not go to sleep, and then I started. The download didn't take too long, but the installation seemed to take a while. (Sorry! I fell asleep for a bit, so I don't know the exact time.) When I woke up about three hours later, it was done.

They told me it would take several months for them to “repair” it and even then, it is “unknown”. I told them I cannot be months without a laptop, and they told me there's essentially nothing they can do. They then turned around and offered a replacement. I asked them if I would have to cover shipping costs to send the faulty product back, and explained that I cannot afford to send a laptop to New York (do y'all know how much that would cost? I can't do it, I'm struggling to get by right now). They got rude with me, saying that they won't cover the costs because I'm past my one year after sales period, even though I'm not?

You can use the one type C port to charge your other equipment and connect other equipment within the laptop it works great. Just make sure when you run all the programs on the system that you update all the drivers especially network drivers. And its true you do feel an electrical shock wow the laptop is connected to the plug. However its warning you that the PC is consuming a lot of energy. If you plan to have your laptop always connected. My recommendation is to open up the laptop which is pretty easy and disconnect the battery. Theres no point to mess up something that works so great right now. The battery charge lasts about two hours and 45 minutes. Processing speed is what you get for for the amount that you are paying.

The 5.4 Bluetooth connection is super stable, and the 40-hour battery life is an exaggeration,— It is more like 28 hours without needing to recharge. The three EQ modes are a nice touch, letting me switch between settings for music, calls, or just drowning out background noise. The four-mic ENC noise cancellation works well for calls; people on the other end say I sound clear even when I'm in a noisy environment. The bass boost is noticeable and adds a nice punch to music without sounding muddy. Comfort-wise, they fit nicely over the ears and don't cause fatigue even during long sessions.

It's one of my fav purchases of the year. I use it every day, especially nights. As I need some air blowing on me while I sleep. Very low background noise. low space profile. It has two speeds. And there is a noticeable difference between them. They both give off good breeze and not an overpowered wind blow. The clip to hold the fan is big and it opens pretty wide as mentioned in the description. It was a concern as to where I would clip it before I ordered but it was for naught. Your table or edge will need at minimum a good 2 inch cleared length of edge if that is where you want to put it. The clip opens pretty wide too appropriately 3-4 inches. It opens wide and will require some hand strength. Once it's clipped on, it has the death grip on the edge or ledge. It will stay on unless you are fiddling around and pull it off. Yeah, I may have done that. It was totally user error tho. Not ""cool breeze"" fault. That's MY fan's name. Lol. Cool breeze gives a strong steady breeze. While white colored, not apparent collecting dust so far. However, all Fans will eventually do the dust collector thing. The fun part is that Cool breeze's head will and does tilt, swivel, flip, dip, dive and twirl to whatever direction your heart desires. Her wish is your command. She also has a twist knob so you can lock her into whatever configuration you want. This may be problematic for those with arthritis. The knob is small and in an awkward but convenient place. Again Her wish is your command. So, If you need a small breeze pointed on you or in your space and don't want a bulky fan sitting on your table or floor in your way, taking up valuable space, then this fan is for you. I don't think you will be disappointed. I am not and I was very skeptical. I am considering buying another for my laundry room. Enjoy.",,False,0

Moves enough for my use within a couple feet of cooled area. Quiet. Would prefer a rotary speed/off select than the slide switch. Like it can be pointed downward since it sits on an above shelf to blow downward. Does not oscillate, but I already knew that, and don't need it for where it is used. Would like the fan blade cage to be easier to separate for dusting (have to use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the halves apart to get inside to dust the blades). I had one before, and this was a replacement. After near 4 years, the old one's motor bearing were getting noisy. Note: The fan blades are simply pressed onto the motor spindle, so friction holds the blades to the spindle. When pointed straight down, the blades will gradually slide off the spindle which will have the blades bang against the cage. Used hot-melt glue to affix blades to spindle. The clamp was sufficiently wide to handle affixing the fan to my headboard (which has a layer for the headboard, and another layer around the edges for decorative trim). This is very quiet which is needed for a fan near the head when sleeping in the bed. The slow speed is enough to cool me off when sleeping (to eliminate waking up sweaty). The head can rotate fore-aft and the stem can rotate 360 degrees, so it pretty much can be pointed in any direction.",,False,0

My beer is cool and cold. My milk stays fresh. that's what happens when you live in Arizona the high temperatures destroy your your refrigerators and your electronics because it runs non-stop to try to stay cool and they can't do it they burn I just had a microwave go out on me because of the heat I was boiling water. and I have a small 2 cubic foot refrigerator with a freezer and a refrigerator unit I put one of the fans blowing air to the coolant and the cooling of the refrigerator. these fans for $11 I have three of them.

I bought this for my mama to use by her bed at night as she has occasional hot flashes and this is much easier than getting up out of bed to turn on the ceiling fan, with this she can cut on and off and adjust as needed. I like the sturdiness of the stand, no worries with it falling back or over. It stays in place exactly how you adjust it. I also like how the power button is in the front. The one I have has the power in the back and have to turn it over to power on. With this option, makes it much easier to turn off and on while in bed and go right back to sleep 😴 💤! Also, the usb plug comes with the wall outlet plug and I have even used the usb plug without the wall plug, in my computer and the fan came right on! You can also use 4 AA batteries to use on the go. Not sure how long it would last on the batteries but definitely a good option to use if needed while out and about. For $14, this is definitely more than what we expected and hope it lasts a good long while. The only thing I dont like is that sometimes the power cord comes out just slightly, just barely out of the socket so you have to make sure it is all the way pushed in or else it will not power on. The first time using, we thought it was malfunctioning, but since we discovered that it has to be all the way in, I mean like no space whatsoever in between lol, it comes right on!",,False,0

I'll start with the positives. First, I love that it can be powered with a USB. This makes it so versatile. With nearly every small device being powered with USB in today's world, that makes this fan able to be powered in the home, vehicles, campers, etc. You could even power it with a portable USB power bank (see pic), making it very travel or camping friendly. Second, you're also able to power it with 4 AA batteries, which makes it versatile (not recommended, see below). Other positives include the portable size, the light weight design, and the stand is adjustable and stiff, meaning, you can alter the angle or direction of the fan. Now the negatives. First, using AA batteries does not last very long. I used AC Delco batteries (not the best, but still good quality batteries), and the fan lasted about 3 hours when on full. Second, there are 3 speeds, however, the first speed seems to hardly move the air. You need your face to be right next to the fan to feel the moving air. I can't really think of many uses for having the fan on the lowest setting. The fan is small enough that you almost always need it on the highest speed to be effective. Overall, I would recommend this fan. If you're a traveler, enjoy camping (in either the tent or camper), or need a little desk fan while you work, this is perfect for you. Just make sure you can power it via the USB rather than AA batteries, otherwise you'll burn through batteries quick.",,False,0

And you basically have to set the camera on the WIFI box to hook it up. One more thing and it's a pet peeve of mine.

From day one, it made loud grinding noises. My other drives do not make these noises. When I checked the drive, it didn't show errors so I checked the cords with alternatives I knew to be working well. The noise was not consistent so I attempted to load files. The files wouldn't show correctly as if they weren't loading onto the drive. When I closed the folder and reopened, they were there. This is also not normal behavior. I also noticed intermittent behaviors were the drive would load much slower than the rest (including another 12 tb with matching files). Sometimes taking 15-20 minutes (I'd give up on it loading and go do something else only to come back and it's loaded). It has caused disk utility to crash and I haven't had that happen before. DU only crashes or loads very slowly when this drive is connected. Sometimes the drive doesn't connect at all. I reached out for support but will likely have to exchange under warranty. I feel there is something not right and I have numerous WD EHD's, this one is not behaving normally. I have a concern of being forced into a refurbished option but my drive is only 2.5 months old and has had this problem since day one.

My WDBFJK004OHBK My WD My Book hard drive is not working correctly, I was in the middle of downloading some files and shut my computer down to run errands and when I came back to finish the files my My Book was no longer showing up in my file explorer, it does show up under the section where it says eject item, it shows up in the drives manager but not the other manager. The hard drive is running, and light shows from the inside.( I ran the WD digital Data Life guard Diagnostics Tool and it shows the my book but says not available)As I said it was working perfectly and my errands took less than 30 minutes when it stopped showing in the file explorer anymore. The more I look into wd hard drives the more I find that thier products have a lot of issues that I did not know about when I looked into the research originally. I tried everything that was suggested. I plugged the hardrive directly into the wall, I shut down the computer a couple of times, I went in and unistalled the my book drive under all the areas you could do that and reinstalled nothing worked!!! this is ridulous how can their products have so many issues this one does not make sense. it was working and than it wasnt and I can not get to my files that I was back up which is the whole point of these products how is wd sitll in business seriously!? Issue 2 I plugged in my passport 2tb external hard drive that was working perfectly and has thousands of vids and other files on it into my WD live Media player to watch something off it and it played for a second (3 issues) but the purple screen that often happens with the WD media showed up again the files played fine but when I was done unplugging the hdmi cable it would not show the files on the screen anymore and now when I plug the passport in my computer to check it it will not show up on my File explorer or the drive file at all now!! This is Crap WD all of this has happened in just the past 3 days in the middle of another Covid shutdown, again how is this company still in business I now have several thousand files, and movies and things that I can now now find or retrieve or whatever!!!?? and these were my backups I only have some of what was on my My Book hardrive that is back uped on another hardrive but some of the best stuff was on this passport that suddenly stopped working or something??!Q!",,False,0

Não imaginei que passaria por isso com esta Marca! Comprei um WD Black de 2TB no final de Fevereiro (02/24), chegou no início de Março (03/02). O Hd começou apresentar ruídos estranhos. Quando verifiquei no ""crystaldiskinfo"" o hd em 30 dias de uso tinha desligado e ligado mais de 531 vezes (04/05)!!! Sendo que um ssd que tenho desde 2018 foi ligado e desligado 331 vezes (04/05)! Depois de 24h de testes de 531 vezes subiu para 773 vezes (04/06)! Entrei em contato três vezes no chat online da WD para tirar dúvidas. Abri um RMA, arquei os custos de frete e enviei para a garantia da WD. Após, a WD enviou-me um HD de troca. Pois bem, o HD apresentou o mesmo problema - em 24h esse HD de troca foi ligado e desligado 103 vezes no crystaldiskinfo (04/27), ou seja o mesmo idêntico problema e mesmo ruído! O HD fica reebotando toda hora! Fiz vários testes dentro do que consegui. Tirei fotos, gravei vídeos, tirei capturas de tela - Isso desde o primeiro HD. Para deixar tudo muito bem registrado da forma mais transparente o possível. Entrei em contato novamente no chat online e expliquei tudo direitinho. Falaram que não podiam dar reembolso. Quem deveria dar era o vendedor. Aí eu questionei: ""Como eu irei solicitar reembolso para quem vendeu o HD, se o HD que foi-me vendido foi devolvido para a Garantia da WD, sendo enviado-me um outro diferente do primeiro com nota fiscal da WD?"" O HD parou de ser reconhecido pelo Windows, tal como o primeiro. Tirei 6 prints(capturas de tela) demonstrando que o HD, de fato, parou de ser reconhecido. Todos os prints eu deixei a tela inteira - sem edição. Entrei em contato novamente no dia 04/27. Fiz tudo que estava ao meu alcance. Deixei tudo documentado. Como não obstante, tive uma resposta que deixou-me indignadissímo. Pois, já havia explicado que o HD tinha parado de ser reconhecido externamente e internamente, desde (04/28). Quando foi (05/06) responderam-me para eu enviar capturas de tela para comprovar que o HD tinha parado mesmo de ser reconhecido SENDO QUE EU JÁ TINHA ENVIADO ISSO NO DIA 04/27 E 04/28. Está sendo uma surpresa para mim passar por isso. Não esperava que os WD Black estivessem dando tantos problemas assim e que o atendimento deixava tanto a desejar. Estou no aguardo de uma tratativa e possibilidade de reembolso.",,False,0

The other thing I don't like is the 500GB size. We need terabytes of storage today, so this is much too small. But when they make the terabyte sizes, I say buy one asap. Until then only buy if you need this small amount of back up or added storage space. Thank you for allowing me to test and review this for you onn. and Home Tester Club, it's a great find.",,False,0

To make matters worse, the return process has been an absolute nightmare. Endless hoops, poor communication, and delays at every step.

The build might look okay on the outside, but performance-wise this laptop feels outdated right out of the box. Honestly, your phone will run faster.

It looks good physically. The operating system look good. I was able to set up my email address, eager to get everything set up in general. I quickly realized that the camera quality was very very poor, wasn't clear at all very dark when I tried to adjust the brightness, the whole screen went white I tried to work with it turning on more lights in the room, etc. nothing work it wasn't even a standard camera. It was horrible. Seriously. After I (which is not even me) settled to keep the laptop because I know that I can plug in a portable WebCam) (but I shouldn't have to if I purchase something it should be quality 100% around across-the-board) I decided to keep it and use a plug-in WebCam because I was so eager to have a freaking laptop when I plug the charger into the outlet I got a very, very huge spark!!! Much much bigger than the average minor spark! Come to find out that spark calls, the charger not to work. I tried several chargers from my work laptops, my old laptop, and my daughter's laptop. None of them work I shouldn't have to purchase a laptop charger on top of the camera to have my laptop working that was the last straw. Lord knows what else I would have discovered the laptop is very very light super light, which kind of bothered me, but as long as it was working, compared to a standard laptop is not as light as the one that I purchase here. Anyway, I was able to get a refund thank God I turned it back into Walmart. Unfortunately I was not able to reset the computer to factory settings so that was disappointing because I could not get back into the laptop. Thankfully I did not have any personal information I only logged into Outlook and pulled up the browsing system , such a disappointment. Such time wasted on going to Walmart waiting for a refund waiting for AFFIRM to clear out my purchase. I now have another laptop on the way that has great reviews and great specs. Please do your research please re-all the reviews I even saw one laptop on Walmart website (not sold by Walmart because Walmart has different vendors that they can sell and use the Walmart platform) anyway one laptop review said that when people received it, they found a sticker for the 16 GB underneath the sticker was the real specs of only 4 GB and it was advertised for 16 GB so please read the reviews I am a real person. I would not take all this time if I did not care or wasn't real and want to help someone else.

Setting it up was super simple, and the connection to my phone through the Runmifit app was seamless. What really stands out is the Bluetooth calling feature—it works flawlessly, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for a smartwatch in this price range. The fitness tracking is accurate and covers all the basics like steps, heart rate, and calories, which is exactly what I need. The battery life is solid too. I get about two days of use, which is more than I expected given all the features it offers. Overall, this watch completely exceeded my expectations.

Go back and select Settings ‐ Display - Turn on Wrist Raise (This lights up your watch every time you raise your arm/ wrist). I waited a few minutes, and then turned it off. My battery has been just below full for two days so far. Reducing the vibration or putting it on mute also provides better measurements. Actually, anything I'm not using is turned off until I need it. My only disappointment is the sleep tracker does not give a Last Seven Day Report unless I view it directly in the app. The rotating bezel is a huge plus for my fat fingers. The most valuable feature is the Find Phone. Misplacing my phone occurs many times throughout the day. Don't worry if your phone is on mute. It will continue to vibrate until you find it. Off mute, it sounds off pretty loud. Along with other shortcuts, and decent set of workout videos provided by the app, this was money well spent! I hope this helps.",,False,0

So this microphone is no exception. It is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to record high-quality audio with a versatile and easy-to-use microphone. This microphone has two recording patterns - cardioid and omnidirectional - which makes it ideal for a wide range of recording scenarios. The cardioid recording pattern is perfect for recording sound from a single source, such as a person speaking directly into the microphone. On several runs it perfectly picks up sound from the front of the microphone and rejects sound from the sides and rear, which helps to reduce background noise and improve the clarity of the recorded audio. Excellent for anyone dabbling into podcasting etc. The omnidirectional recording pattern, on the other hand, is ideal for recording sound from multiple sources or for capturing ambient sound. It picks up sound from all directions, which makes it perfect for recording group conversations, musical performances, or environmental sounds. One of the best things about this microphone is pretty easy and straight forward to use. It connects to your laptop via a USB cable and requires no additional drivers or software. Simply plug it in, select the recording pattern you want to use, and start recording. We have not used it with any other devices such as tablets or if it integrates with a phone as seamlessly as with our laptop. But given how nicely it has been made, we imagine it would be a simple process there, too. In terms of sound quality, this microphone delivers excellent results. Perfect for our house needs recording kids videos and all. It seems to be able to handle professional grade recording just fine as well. Pretty decent signal-to-noise ratio, which helps to reduce background noise and improve the clarity of the recorded audio. So, overall, we would highly recommend this microphone to anyone who needs a versatile and easy-to-use recoding device for high-quality audio. Whether you're a podcaster, musician, video creator, or simply use it for family needs (as we do) this microphone is sure to deliver excellent results.",,False,0

Cardioid and omnidirectional mode options provide great sound options for podcasts or general voice recording. It's heavier than it looks and even though it's plastic, it doesn't feel or look like a budget friendly microphone. I wanted to try it out and expected to go through some song and dance click fest with warnings and software download prompts, but I got none of that with this on an iMac. On a side note, you may or may not have to set your audio input in the settings if you want to keep it attached and set as default. The USB to USB-C cord is plenty long and feels very durable. On the back of the microphone you have options. You can attach headphones using standard 3.5 mm jack. There's also the option to switch between cardioid or omnidirectional audio. Cardioid mode picks up sounds that are coming from a more precise direction (straight ahead) and omnidirectional picks up all sounds from all directions. There's also an option to attach the microphone to a tripod or hang it to prevent tipping or knocking it over if it's on a desk or table. The button on the front has two colors to let you know when it's muted or actively recording. Blue is recording, red is muted. This is useful in two ways. You can be assured you're not getting any unwanted sounds and also allows for another person to use their own microphone without anyone shifting places or weird scratching sounds while adjusting or moving the microphone.

It lowers the overall volume at which people hear me to such a low point that they cant hear me until i go back into the setting and fix it. Another issue is that on occasion the headset will “jam comms” as my buddy calls it, in which it apparently messes with the audio increasing my volume exponentially and will completely and utterly garble any word that comes out of my mouth until i reset the headset and replug in the dongle. When i attempted to use bluetooth the audio was atrocious and sounded worse than an xbox 360 headset from over a decade ago. Audio is fine when using the dongle besides the previously stated issues. As well, on the application for it on my pc it doesnt allow me to adjust it in any way shape or form. I cannot recommend this product without lying.",,False,0

First, Corsair all but insists that you use the iCue with your hardware. Problem is, it does absolutely NOTHING for this hardware. Like.. Zero. Nothing. At all. Second, for $100 I kinda expect my headset to stay in one piece for longer than 6 months. Not the case here. (*NOTE* I am particularly careful with electronics, and have taken good care of this headset...) First problem was one of the earpads just kinda fell off. Didn't pop off or give any indication of an issue, just fell off while I was pulling them off of my head. So, I bought new ones. Not a huge deal, but I'd rather not have to have spent that $20. Next, a month or so later, one of the little covers just above the ear piece (kinda triangular, it covers wires and such) also just... fell off. While the headset was being worn, just sitting listening to a video. *plonk* - Right on top of my head, then down onto my shirt and off to the floor. This is all just very poor craftmanship.

My second concern is that when I am using the headset for work (windows 11 PC) it works great for the most part but my mic is muted even though it is flipped down. Now this is an intermittent issue but a critical issue as I am an inbound call center rep and the issue has occurred at the beginning of receiving a call. I use it with the avaya software as well as Microsoft teams, my mic gets muted when flipped down regardless of the software I'm using at the time. The only “fix” I have found is to flip the mic back up, wait a second and then flip it back down and it'll then unmute. Other than these 2 concerns, the headset is super comfortable - I wear glasses and rarely feel discomfort, it has great audio quality and noise cancellation for both the mic and earpieces.

Audio: The audio is good for a ""gaming headset"". I say this because headphones made by gaming companies don't offer superior audio compared to headsets made by actual audio companies. But the audio in these are great. Good enough bass, EQ, volume, etc. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but unless you're downgrading from an expensive set, you should be satisfied with the sound quality of these. Controls: The controls are great and straightforward. You have a volume dial on the side and an adjustable microphone. The volume dial is great in that it changes the volume on the device you're connected to, not the volume of the headset itself. This means you don't have two different volumes on both the device and the headphones, you just have one single volume. This is great for convenience, as it means no more fiddling with my Windows volume and headphones volume, it's all set to just one single volume. Build quality: In order to achieve its lightweightness, it had to use materials that are also light as well. This means it will feel ""cheap"", like a ""toy"". But it's because of the light plastic and build design. So I can get why people may see it this way, but it personally feels just fine to me. It feels sturdy enough that I don't mind it. And when it comes to it, you really have only two options: Lighter headset, but less premium feel, or heavier headset, but more premium feel. In this case, I prefer a headset that doesn't weigh much, so I'm willing to accept the build quality. The straps and ear cushions feel great as well, and are quite soft without being too soft or too firm. Microphone: The microphone has a great feature where if you put it up, it auto disables itself, and vice versa. The quality is... Not great. If you want professional quality and sound, get an actual standalone mic. Most headset mics, regardless of company, will sound subpar in comparison. But if you don't mind that, then this will suffice. The communication is clear enough in my opinion, and teammates will be able to easily hear you without too much noise or diminished quality. Wireless aspect: It uses a USB. This is an upside and a downside. The upside: You get way less latency. The downside: You don't get Bluetooth. So if your desired device won't take USB, then you basically can't use these with them. Battery life: Lasts me a good amount of time. I can go days without charging it, and I use it a lot daily for videos, music, etc. at around 75% volume. It also has a battery saving feature where it can auto shutoff when it detects it's not in use, which is pretty neat. Overall: Great if you want a light, wireless headset from a reputable brand and don't mind any of the minor downsides that come with it. I recommend purchasing if it's in your budget and you are interested at this point.",,False,0

I was SHOCKED at how good of quality these were. I handed them to my younger (adult) brother who is, like me, pretty technically savvy and appreciative of good pairs of headphones. We already have a range of high-quality headphones from Sennheiser, Sony and Skullcandy (their Bluetooth Crushers are amazing for bassheads btw). Anyway, I had him try these headphones on and check out the quality and tell me what he thinks I paid for them. He guessed $120! I personally think that's high, but these are seriously worth at least $50, and if someone had done the same thing with me, I probably would have guessed the retail cost being around $70-80. I just HAD to buy a second pair right away! The cushions are good quality and comfortable, the plastic does NOT feel cheap or fragile, and the headset is very decently sized! My brother and I both have large heads and these fit very comfortably. The headband has metal reinforcement and is very well cushioned. The mic cable is metal and although very easily manipulable, holds its position solidly without fail. The long cable for the connections is hugh quality cloth and all of the connections are very well done so I don't see them getting damaged anytime soon. Even eith all this quality, the headset is still very light and soft on your ears. its clear it was thoughtfully designed for gaming for extended periods. They come with a USB connection, but this seems to only power the LEDs on the headset. The 3.5mm connector the headset has built in is for a mic/headphone combo jack which would work great on a compatible phone or Xbox/Playstation controller, but in case youre using these with a desktop computer that has the mic and headphone jack separated, they come with an adapter for that too. If the manufacturer can make this wired headset for so cheap that it retaisl for $10, they should seriously consider making a Bluetooth version and retailing jt for $15-$20. It would knock out any and all competition in that category at that price point. If you don't mind wired headphones, BUY THESE! You wont regret it!",,False,0

This is one of those times where the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" comes into play. There is one, and only one, button on this whole screen and it is a toggle like a joystick that you would find on a game controller. Using this toggle is clunky and awkward, especially with your arm around the screen. Toggling through available selections and selecting something to change is a nightmare all in it's own. This wouldn't be such a big deal if I was only using one input but I often switch between the two and the functionality just ins't there. It's stupid, to say the least. My favorite part is that sometimes when switching between inputs, nothing happens, and you have to unplug the cable you're not trying to use. Lucikly my desk is set up in a way that I can get to the back of it easily, but I shouldn't have to. Aside from input control, the on screen text leaves something to be disired - the font looks...pixelated? I don't know how to explain it other than to say it is NOT clear. If it wasn't for the size of the screen, I would have trouble reading. I have not used this monitor for gaming, so I can't speak to that, but I have used it for streaming which is just o.k. The blacks aren't very deep and the colors are so so. I am using this as a second monitor to a Dell laptop and the Dell is crystal clear for comparison.

Some pros and cons about the phone: Pros 1. I like the size and weight of the phone. Yes, it is made of plastic and not feeling premium. But the biggest advantage is that it is light. I don't feel tired of holding the phone for a long period of time. I also like the aspect ratio of the phone. It is not too tall nor wide. Yes it has side screen bezel, but that doesn't bother me too much. I think the size is about right. 2. It's an android without too much add-ons. Pretty close to the original stock android. 3. It has a headphone jack! 4. As long as not running intensive apps, phone temperature is not bad. Cons: 1. It's a budget phone. Can't expect too much performance. Basical tasks such as web browsing, youtubing and messaging via text app will get the jobs done. But any heavy intensive apps will slow down the phone quite a bit and it just lag. 2. The speaker is on the back of the phone and if it is covered up with finger, no sound. So if you lay it down on a flat surface (without a case), you basically can't hear much. With a case, the phone is lifted up a little and the sound is not that bad. 3. Have a review unit and the phone is locked with a specific carrier, can't really test out call quality. During the initial set up. some random apps just keep installing. But after initial setup, no more. So so: 1. The camera is so so. Again, can't expect too much from an entry level phone. It takes pictures, but can't compare the quality to a premium phone. 2. The battery is okay. I think as long as you don't do too much heavy liftings, the battery can last. Standby overnight battery drain is not bad. Things I wish this phone has: 1. In the gesture setting, I wish it has the function to turn on display when the phone is lifted or double tap to awake. Without the function, the only way to wake up the phone is by pressing power button. 2. I wish they change the position of power and volume buttons. Currently, volume buttons are located on the top and power is below it. It takes some time to get used to. Overall, if you are looking for a budget entry level phone. I think it gets job done. Just don't expect too much performance. It is good for basic tasking.",,False,0

But unlike those two, the C110 is light and slightly slimmer, which makes handle and use easier. The back is uniquely Nokia, -scratch-resistant texture and the good-idea speaker slit on the lower-left corner for better output and reception. It's 9/10 user-friendly, providing logical positioning of the home, back and stop buttons, -much better than the Iphone, Samsung and Google Pixel (my current favorite), Start-up had no issues and copying everything from my current had zero glitches. It has only one camera but pixel at 13megap is more than enough that an average person ever uses but the image, though good, is not impressive. The magnification range adjuster comes up when the image is zoomed, and is a smoother option than the tap-choose option on other phones. Video sound is crisp but faint. Sound recording needs to be improved to allow volume increase after recording. Nevertheless, it has enough user-adjustable features and enough options for quick editing and enhancement, Overall, the C110 is a very good phone to have, but needs a big only-on-Nokia identifiable feature, which I was expecting but did not see or feel.",,False,0
