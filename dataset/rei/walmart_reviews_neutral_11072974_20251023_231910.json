      "review_text": "A few weeks ago order some rollers drawers to go between my washer & dryer and they hold quite a bit but the bottles have too be a certain size. So I order 2 of these shelves one to fit on my washer & one for my dryer I order them so I can put any size jugs on them. I usually get family size liquid detergent. One fits my dryer great my boyfriend did have too bend them down a little the directions tell you that you might have too. The top of my dryer is straight but my washer top is rounded the shelf don't fit it as good we had too fix the washer where the shelf will lean up against the wall so we could use it without falling off but evently that will rub my wall. So they are great if the top of your washer & dryer is straight across at the top if they are rounded you need too find something else. Before I ordered these shelves I read the reviews some people complained about the bottles falling off my bottles havene't fell off yet.",

      "review_text": "This was such a great idea...but I didn't think of the curve on the top of the washer or dried! It won't set level so I have to be extra careful when I take things on and off of it. Also, it wasn't made to hold the larger sizes of product. It moves around as you take things off it. It would probably be OK if my drier didn't have that slight curve to it. The front arms need to be a bit longer. Also, the back arms need to be bent to work for the machine which can cause that to lean back some which is why the front arms need to be longer. I wish there was a better way to secure it to the machine. I'm going to have to figure out a way to make it stay firmly on the machine. I think even if I didn't have that slight curve the would be a huge problem.",
