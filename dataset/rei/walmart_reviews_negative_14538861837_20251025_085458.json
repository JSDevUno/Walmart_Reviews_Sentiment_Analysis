I tried to charge the phone with the power cord provided connected to the PC. And that was hopeless. I ended up calling \"Straight Talk\" Customer Service. To have my other phone re-activated, and ordered a different phone, before I ended the call. I can only assume that the company sent me a refurbished phone, even though it is not mentioned anywhere in the ad. And by the way. That customer service representative who handled my complaint was stellar and great! Also, I can't do a return, cause the phone will not charge. As in, it will not hold a charge. it lights up zero. So I cannot return it back to factory settings. My info is still on the phone. I know now that my seven years of bad luck begins with this company(Motorola). Money down the toilet. Bring Back \"LG and Huawei\". At least we always knew what we were getting, and where we stood with them.",

Also I've had an issue w an ironic case of while a missed call was leaving me a voicemail, I just so happened received another call that I wasn't even notified of & it didn't even show up in my missed call log . Luckily they left a message & it was recorded there & also in my visual voicemail as it was an important call as it was a from Dr office of whom my Dr referred me to to make an appointment to a cardiologist, so that was a terrible glitch for me personally so why I took a way another star.",
