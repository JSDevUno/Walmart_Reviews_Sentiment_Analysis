Too bad, as Walmart sells it in the jewelry craft section. Possibly useful for making clothes or shoe laces. Terrible for jewelry.",

The amount of black dye that washed out of it just with water was unbelievable. Plus, it's very coarse and would feel uncomfortable against the skin. This is unusable.",
