Ain't no way in heck a 20,000 battery should have gone through 25% of its charge for 5% phone battery. Have 8000mah batteries that gave almost two full charges before being empty. Second, it does not support fast charging or type c to type c charging. Must rely on slower, outdated USB ports. 3rd, both batteries make this God awful whining sound when charging. Tried different cords, same result. Will most definitely be requesting a refund",

I purchased a battery with half the capacity as this one a few years ago for a little bit more money and it lasts longer and is much better quality. The one I have will charge my phone about 2 times, this one wont even charge it past 30%. When using this pack the usb port won't allow you to fully insert the chargers, which is distressing. Not to mention when charging the battery or charging with the battery, it gets unnervingly warm whereas the other 2 I own from different brands don't get warm at all.. For the price it's cheap enough to where I'm not worried about a return or a refund but I wouldn't recommend it, just spend a little bit more and get a battery that is much better quality.
