I ordered BOTH ITEMS at the same time. The delivery kept getting pushed back. So now I have something that I no longer need. Maybe I'll just return it. I knew at the time I needed an adapter to use it and that's why I ordered them together. Maybe you could consider adding an apple adapter to switch it from a usb C to apple lightening adapter.",

She instructed me to come to the pickup door on the side and call when I was there. I called. The mailbox was full, four employees walked by and didn't even acknowledge my presence. Mind you, it was 32 degrees outside. I stood there for 15 minutes waiting for one of the employees to stop leaning and sitting (in clear view) to come to the door and engage me. If I return, I won't use the unprofessional pickup service. This was a horrible customer service experience. If I could leave zero stars, I would. Training is definitely needed! Or a more customer service oriented staff needs to be hired to replace the crew that I encountered.",
