      "title": "The Paint Never Cured!",
      "review_text": "I bought the Glidden Spred Grab-N-Go interior latex paint, semi-gloss finish in the color Farm from Walmart on April 21, 2025. We painted our bathroom with it a few days later. The walls were originally painted with flat white paint as a primer, and my husband made a few repairs to the sheet rock with drywall joint compound in a few places before we painted, so some surfaces were bare finished sheet rock and some were previously painted. I've been painting walls in houses for the past 40 years, and I've never had a paint do this. After the paint had dried to the touch, we removed the painter's masking tape. On one wall near the shower, the paint peeled off with the tape as if it were a stretchy sheet of latex. I thought maybe the wall there didn't get prepped as well as it should, so I removed the paint, sanded the wall, wiped the dust off, and painted it again. There were a few other places where the paint still felt gummy, so we put fans in the room and waited a few more days before attempting to remove the rest of the masking tape. After that, the tape mostly came off without damaging the paint, and I touched up the few places that peeled. The paint still felt kind of soft, so we decided to wait a few days more before we started to put trim and the mirror back up. After almost 2 weeks, the paint still felt soft, so I contacted Walmart to request a refund. I also called Glidden to report my issue and ask for advice as to how to get the paint to cure. The representative suggested that we get plenty of air flow into the room, which we had already done. My husband had the idea to put a space heater in there and close the door, and the representative agreed that was worth a try. He had no other suggestions except that if it didn't cure, I would most likely have to remove the paint and start over. ðŸ˜• Our best guess is that the paint was frozen in shipping somewhere before it got to the store since the manufacture date on the can is February. It's now been almost a month, and the paint has stayed soft. Any little bump against the wall makes a nick in the paint, including just brushing against it lightly with a fingernail. Today, I decided to remove some of the paint at those nicked places, and the paint just peels away like dead skin. It's going to take hours to remove all the paint from the walls. I'm not sure I trust this product enough to buy another one and repaint or if I'm just going to wallpaper the whole room. This is very frustrating. I would like to add that the color and coverage of this paint were great. Applying the paint was easy. But none of that matters if the paint never dries. Another note. We did purchase a second gallon of this exact paint except in the color white. We painted our doors and trim with it, and it cured just fine. https://youtube.com/shorts/TjJZBwVIgo4?si=AEUGKTJa_irRHDvP",
