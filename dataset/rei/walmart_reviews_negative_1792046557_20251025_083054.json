It uses a suspension band instead of sliding ear cups, and the band only has two possible positions. Plus earcups are stationary and do not rotate. -Sound quality. Unbalanced and very slightly muffled. Other features tend to fall to preference wuch as wired vs wireless or mesh vs leatherette ear cups. So overall, functions as a wireless headset, but I much prefer the wired G432 for its better sound quality and adjustablity.",

      "review_text": "I would've rated this 5 stars but I have a few concerns/issues regarding this headset and I'm hoping the manufacturer/merchant sees this review and offers help. My first concern is that there were no written instructions or any kind of paperwork/manual in the box; it just contained the headset with the headband, USB receiver and the charging cord, no user documentation as it states on the box. My second concern is that when I am using the headset for work (windows 11 PC) it works great for the most part but my mic is muted even though it is flipped down. Now this is an intermittent issue but a critical issue as I am an inbound call center rep and the issue has occurred at the beginning of receiving a call. I use it with the avaya software as well as Microsoft teams, my mic gets muted when flipped down regardless of the software I'm using at the time. The only “fix” I have found is to flip the mic back up, wait a second and then flip it back down and it'll then unmute. Other than these 2 concerns, the headset is super comfortable - I wear glasses and rarely feel discomfort, it has great audio quality and noise cancellation for both the mic and earpieces. I really like this headset, I can see myself using it for a long time; I just need to find a way to fix the mic muting issue!",
