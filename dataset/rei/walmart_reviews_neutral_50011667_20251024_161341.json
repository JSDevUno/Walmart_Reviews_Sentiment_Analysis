It looks like a mold ring anywhere they were placed for an extended time. They were removed from a drawer and placed in the pantry and still a ring. They sat dry out of the box on my countertop and left rings. Lucky they didnt sit there for very long. I have large rings from the plates, medium from the saucer and the bowls leave rings as well. Photos attached, before and after I wiped them with bleach. On the other hand, I love the colors, I was looking for nontoxic dinnerware.",
