      "review_text": "We have not yet used this item even though we have carefully checked it out for sturdiness, mobility, and usefulness; we may save it to use as a gift. The entire unit offers multiple storage sections of varying sizes to accommodate both smaller items as well as some larger ones. Having the base section...which is sizeable...offers mobile use when different areas of work are needed. The adjustable handle is also a very handy feature whether one is transporting one storage section, two sections, or all three. Each removeable section is fastened with sturdy clips that are easy to open as well as back clips to be used when one wishes to remove a section to use separately(see bottom pic). Although this item may be viewed more as something the fellows would use, I believe the ladies will also benefit from possessing one of these units for their gardening needs outside or even for crafts designs as sometimes many small decorative pieces are needed; the top section has multiple small compartments for such items to prevent spillage. I believe most anyone could find a handy use for this particular product that would offer many years of service and options. The only drawback to this unit as I see it would be the heavy weight of some larger tools inside along with the other sections filled to capacity; but, having the cart on wheels makes it mobile so it may not be a problem for the guys. Nice product...thank you.",

      "title": "A flexible storage system for all your needs",
      "review_text": "The HART Mobile Tool Storage System is do-it-yourselfers' ultimate solution to tool storage and organization challenges. It has three stackable sections. The bottom section is wide enough to hold power tools such as a reciprocating saw, a drill, etc... The middle section is not as big, but would still fit smaller tools such as a jigsaw, a sander, etc… plus has a tray for small tools such as a level, tape measure, square etc. This tray can be used in either one of the bottom two sections. The top section is a tray with ten removable compartments for small items such screws, nails, drill bits, etc. Depending on your job need, you have the option to use all three sections at once, only the base section or the base plus one of the other two. The whole system can be rolled around with the help of two solid 7-inch wheels and an extendable handle, a great feature that makes reaching your job site a lot easier especially if you have to go up or down the steps. The top two sections can be released from the storage system and have strong handles so you can carry them away if space is restricted for the whole system. It is worth mentioning that the top tray has a lid that sinks into the ten compartments creating a seal for your items so they don't scatter inside the tray and it is clear so tray contents are visible. Each section interlocks with the section below it for stability while rolling it around and for even more security, the bottom two sections can be locked with padlocks. All three sections come equipped with two strong latches to secure their lids down. If you are a do-it-yourselfer, a craftsman or just need a flexible storage system, The Hart Mobile Tool Storage System is for you. It has a look and feel of high quality construction and presents a variety of storage and organization options depending on your need. Its two wheels and retractable handle allow you to move part or all of the storage system around with ease.",
