      "review_text": "I am reviewing the Airwalk Men's & Big Men's Graphic Printed Fleece Hoodie (Flazy) Color Heather Grey Size M. First things first, the size is a little bigger than a medium. So your large body could fit into this sweatshirt if you wanted to. I had not been familiar with the brand and the types of prints prior to this shirt. Airwalk has been around for a few years. According to WikiPedia, it started at JC Penney. My interest was the sweatshirt and how it fits and feels. I think I covered fit in the first paragraph. The shirt itself is really nothing special. It is a blended fabric like so many others sold in Walmart, Target, Dollar General, etc.... That means that this shirt is one you buy because you like the Airwalk brand or you think the print is cool. I think the print is cool. So I like it. Typical sweatshirt, aka: Hoodie. Cool print. Buy it because of the design. Do not think that it is a special sweatshirt or Hoodie variant. This sweatshirt has caused me to think about other Airwalk branded products. I will look into those and see if I can match them with my new hoodie. It is fashionable and drives my child crazy that I know the brand and am wearing this hoodie. She does not think it is cool on me! Look at the photos and decide for yourself.",

      "review_text": "I ordered the Airwalk Hooded Sweatshirt in a Men’s size Medium. When it arrived, I was impressed with the way it looked. The problem came when I tried to put it on to see how it looked on me and I was disappointed to find I could barely get my head through the neck opening. The sweatshirt just seemed to be undersized for a Medium. Even my wife, who is much smaller than I am, thought the neck opening was very small, too. Aside from being too small for me, I liked the design features with a small logo in pink on the front, pink “walking people” on both sleeves, a large 9.5x9 inch (predominately pink and black) walking person on the back, and even a pink logo on the top of the hood. I liked the oversized front pocket (14x9 inches) which is large enough to hold gloves, keys, phone, wallet or to keep your hands warm in cold weather. I like how the wrist cuffs and waistband has a nice stretch to them. The fleece lining will definitely keep you warm in cold weather. The half-inch wide drawstring for the hoodie was nice and strong. The workmanship appears to be superb. I liked everything about this hoodie. I just need a size (or two) larger.",

The material is thin enough to move with you, but thick enough to keep you warm when there's a chill in the air. The drawstrings have heat shrink on the ends of them which are softer and much better than the hard plastic most others use. The tag is a little itchy, but that is easily solved by cutting it out. The hood isn't too heavy feeling which I like because it doesn't feel like it's in the way.",
