In the past few months, it is now a different chemical makeup, slightly different shape and is more a crystalline puck which turns into a blobby mound.

Normally, when you drop a fresh tablet into a tank, you get an initial stiff dose of chlorine smell from it, before it settles down to a steady, low dose. Not this time. And it has had no effect in keeping bacterial growth in check. A 'normal' tablet remains solid and gradually shrinks in size as the material slowly dissolves. This batch quickly dissolves into a semi-crystalline blob of mush. I found this out when I lifted the tank lid to see why the fill was running on. The flapper had warped and wouldn't seal. Admittedly, the flapper was very old, an easy fix and everyone says this can happen with cleaner tablets, but the timing struck me as odd.

I had to take an antihistamine quickly and open the window, and my husband had to take my son outside so he could drink the juice! So ridiculous. The price is a few pennies cheaper than other brands, and we are a lower-income family--so we picked this product and ordered it online. Sadly the ingredients label wasn't updated in the photos. I tookj a photo showing the new label contains these three serious allergens. I tried uploading it as a JPG 194 KB (well under the 5 MB max) and it failed, and then tried uploading as a PNG image (1.14 MB -- still well under the 5 MB max) and that failed as well. The website says there is a problem even though my pic is well under maximum of 5MB. I have tried uploading and re-creating this post in both my Chrome browser and in Microsof Edge Browser, but no option works for a successful upload, so that isn't fair either.

When he sampled it, it was clearly distasteful, as if it had fermented and soured. This was despite opening it on the ""Best By"" date. We threw it out. Last week, I decided to give this product another try. The ""Best By""date for the container I purchased is Sept. 16. (There is no year printed on the bottle, but I assumed it was for 2023.) When I opened the bottle, it made a slight fizzing sound, but the juice seemed fine. But over the next four days it became progressively more sour and seemingly carbonated. Again, we had to toss most of the OJ. I had thought that our first experience was a one-off. But when it happened a second time, I thought you should know.

Aside from the homemade one you make at home, this is the next best thing, it comes really close to homemade. It's just the right amount of avocados, creaminess, thickness and spices. Most other store - bought guacamole are either too acidic, too garlicky or too salty. But this one is just right. It's the closet thing next to homemade. I highly recommend it.

Despite all this, we've only seen minimal improvement. Curious about the difference, I found an old tube of the Honest Diaper Rash Cream and compared the ingredients. After reading through older reviews, it became clear that the formula has changed. Sadly, the new formula hasn't been effective in protecting my baby's skin.
