I purchased a new box several weeks ago and realized the box looks the same but the content packaging and size of the tablets has changed. They are most definitely NOT the same product I've always received. Skip to today when I realized the toilets in the house were already starting to have a film and form rings. This only ever used to happen when the tablet dissolved completely. Now it's happening before it's dissolved, AND it is creating cloudy water in the tank and bubbles as it flushes. I noticed that a couple weeks ago and was confused but at the time didn't connect the two. The formula HAS TO GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA. THESE ARE ABSOLUTE TRASH! I will be looking elsewhere for these now. Absolutely the worst product change I have ever witnessed with my own eyes! They do not work anymore!",

That was about a month ago. So, I decided to go in-store to pick up a box. It's the same crumby crud! I guess they changed manufacturers or something.

What a mess to get out the tanks! My husband got the mass of gooey stuff out of them had to use an old kitty litter scoop, then keep flushing the tank out with a hose!

I used them at home and at my business. They worked great at both places, especially at my private nail studio. I have hard water there and tend to have a constant reoccurring water ring. If I'm off for the weekend and the toilet isn't flushed for a day or 2, the ring returns. Since using these tablets, I have not seen the ring! Each tablet is very long lasting. They are conveniently sold at Walmart stores everywhere. As long as these tablets are available, I will continue using them! I would love to try them in different scents too! Maybe lavender? Lime?

      "review_text": "Have been using this product for years and years. More than a decade. As many others have written, Walmart recently changed this product, but the packaging is the same. Used to be a pressed cake of a powder type product. Lasted 2-3 months and did a great job. It would slowly dissolve and shrink to a smaller and smaller puck. In the past few months, it is now a different chemical makeup, slightly different shape and is more a crystalline puck which turns into a blobby mound. And does not last nearly as long, which means your bowl starts to get dirty much faster. I can't imagine why anyone would continue to use this product, having experienced the effectiveness of the prior. With all these one star ratings, you'd think Walmart would want to fix this mistake but who knows. We're changing to Clorox, which I believe is a slightly smaller puck, at a higher price unfortunately...but at least it works! Also, don't know if it's a coincidence but some of the rubber and plastic parts in the the flapper/valve assembly have disintegrated substantially. Even the tube which provides the water fill has become gummy, semi-melted, and it doesn't even sit in the water! I have a feeling there's some nasty chemical(s) in this new formulation which are particularly corrosive to rubber and or vinyl plastics. So not only less effective but potentially destroying the parts inside the tank, including the gaskets! Get ready for a leak!",

I was fortunate enough to receive the four tablet box but the way they were packaged brought the star rating down. After all, I was afraid that if cut incorrectly to separate the two tablet packs, I'd accidentally open both. Once open though, it was very easy to use. After all, you simply took the lid off the toilet tank and dropped it into the corner. You do have to wait about 20 minutes before you can flush it but it's worth the wait. I've noticed my toilet to be much shinier and less noticeably smelly. It seems to be doing a good job preventing staining and sticking and hasn't caused any issue while flushing. It does look interesting in the tank but because it seems to be working, I'll keep an eye on when to replace it. It doesn't seem to disappear quickly and that's appreciated. Overall, I'm glad I was able to try this and do appreciate how much easier it's made cleaning the toilet. Definitely a worthwhile cleaning item! Thank you!!",

After a week I tried stirring up the blob only to find it stuck to the bottom of the tank. It's been a few weeks now and it's still sitting there doing nothing. Throwing away the rest of the pack. Looks like I may need to drain the tank and scrub the rest of it out. Complete waste of money. Even the old formula on occasion would sit there as a hard tablet and not dissolve without breaking it into pieces. All I want is a simple bleach tablet without extra colors or scents. Will have to find something else.",

There is no strong scent of bleach, which I'm honestly thankful for because a strong bleach scent can give me a headache. So far, I feel these are working in keeping my toilet bowl clean between deep cleanings. I do see a lot of bubbles in the toilet water after each flush, as I would with other toilet bowl cleaner tablets.

      "review_text": "I've been using this and similar products for many years and am aware of how they normally work. I have to agree with other folks that this product has been reformulated or changed and is no longer effective. Normally, when you drop a fresh tablet into a tank, you get an initial stiff dose of chlorine smell from it, before it settles down to a steady, low dose. Not this time. And it has had no effect in keeping bacterial growth in check. A 'normal' tablet remains solid and gradually shrinks in size as the material slowly dissolves. This batch quickly dissolves into a semi-crystalline blob of mush. I found this out when I lifted the tank lid to see why the fill was running on. The flapper had warped and wouldn't seal. Admittedly, the flapper was very old, an easy fix and everyone says this can happen with cleaner tablets, but the timing struck me as odd. Bottom line: 'Bleaching Action' is not the same as actual chlorine bleach in these products. This formulation relies on borax and I will avoid such in the future, as it absolutely doesn't work for me.",

It's been a great way to keep the toilet looking nice in between cleanings. I like that the package comes with plenty of tabs so that we can use in every toilet in the house. This makes it an affordable option for toilet maintenance. There is no scent, and it is bleaching so no color change to the toilet bowl either.",
