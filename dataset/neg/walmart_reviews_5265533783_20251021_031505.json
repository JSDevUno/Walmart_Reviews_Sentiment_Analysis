I purchased a new box several weeks ago and realized the box looks the same but the content packaging and size of the tablets has changed. They are most definitely NOT the same product I've always received. Skip to today when I realized the toilets in the house were already starting to have a film and form rings. This only ever used to happen when the tablet dissolved completely. Now it's happening before it's dissolved, AND it is creating cloudy water in the tank and bubbles as it flushes. I noticed that a couple weeks ago and was confused but at the time didn't connect the two. The formula HAS TO GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA. THESE ARE ABSOLUTE TRASH! I will be looking elsewhere for these now. Absolutely the worst product change I have ever witnessed with my own eyes! They do not work anymore!",
