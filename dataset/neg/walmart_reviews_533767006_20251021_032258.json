Aside from the homemade one you make at home, this is the next best thing, it comes really close to homemade. It's just the right amount of avocados, creaminess, thickness and spices. Most other store - bought guacamole are either too acidic, too garlicky or too salty. But this one is just right. It's the closet thing next to homemade. I highly recommend it.
