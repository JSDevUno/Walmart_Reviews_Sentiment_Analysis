      "review_text": "Everything worked great on it. Really appreciated a few things about this device. 1. The cable on it has a decent bit of length. Lots of cheap hubs give you just a few inches of cable to work with. 2. Having three ports on the top. A lot easier for plugging in jump drives and the like since you just push them down, other hubs you have to pick the hub up because the ports are all on the side. 3. The ports are arranged \"vertically\" rather than \"horizontally\". You'll know what I'm talking about if you've ever had a usb device that was really wide and you had to unplug the adjacent ports for it to fit in. Shouldn't have that problem here - awesome!",
