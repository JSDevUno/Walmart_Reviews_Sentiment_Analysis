I kind of wish my usb wires could have fit down more flush with the unit but, its not too big of a deal as long as it still can send and receive data through an ssd or phone. The other thing i noticed is that the wire coming out does twist a hair when moving it but its not coming loose any time soon. I currently have mine set up flat with some velcro to keep it firmly in place. Overall, its a descent 4 port hub. i however may not use my ssd on it when i get said ssd. Charging my phone and maybe moving my logitech mouse dongle to it is probably how i will end up using this since i am currently using a laptop with limited usb ports available. It probably would be okay though for ssd too but i'm just not gonna. I feel its well worth the price listed though and because it works.",
