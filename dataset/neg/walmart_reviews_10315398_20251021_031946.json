I'm trying to refund, but for days, the site says its having problems. i have some other things I have to return before my date expires like it did on some other grocery orders. I don't drive ( whole reason for having delivery) and my husband is 86 and hates returning things, so I got stuck with around $30 of substituted items that were either not a good switch or something we wouldn't like. Some things cost more than what I ordered.,like my dogs Good nFun treatsĺ I just hope I can reach someone to return the $21 for3 pair underwear. I accidentally ordered. I wish they had a pick up for returns...that would sure help us old disabled people .",

I am so disappointed. I have a severe allergy to inhaled particles of soy and eggs--and a few minutes after I poured a glass of orange juice for my son, my throat began to get tight! I had to take an antihistamine quickly and open the window, and my husband had to take my son outside so he could drink the juice! So ridiculous. The price is a few pennies cheaper than other brands, and we are a lower-income family--so we picked this product and ordered it online. Sadly the ingredients label wasn't updated in the photos. I tookj a photo showing the new label contains these three serious allergens. I tried uploading it as a JPG 194 KB (well under the 5 MB max) and it failed, and then tried uploading as a PNG image (1.14 MB -- still well under the 5 MB max) and that failed as well. The website says there is a problem even though my pic is well under maximum of 5MB. I have tried uploading and re-creating this post in both my Chrome browser and in Microsof Edge Browser, but no option works for a successful upload, so that isn't fair either. But believe me there are REAL traces of these allergens in the product now, if anyone in your family is allergic to these allergens, then DON'T buy this product.",

When he sampled it, it was clearly distasteful, as if it had fermented and soured. This was despite opening it on the \"Best By\" date. We threw it out. Last week, I decided to give this product another try. The \"Best By\"date for the container I purchased is Sept. 16. (There is no year printed on the bottle, but I assumed it was for 2023.) When I opened the bottle, it made a slight fizzing sound, but the juice seemed fine. But over the next four days it became progressively more sour and seemingly carbonated. Again, we had to toss most of the OJ. I had thought that our first experience was a one-off. But when it happened a second time, I thought you should know. We will not be purchasing this product again. I'm not asking for a refund. I'm just giving you feedback.",
