Cutting to the good part isnt safe with mold due to spores you wont see. the specks and fuzzy appearance are a dead giveaway.

But it's due to the extra processing to make these so convenient that you don't have to do any prep work. Zero prep work! I lose so many leaves from whole Brussels sprouts that the wasted scrap is a considerable amount and I have never had to throw away any leaves from these ready to cook sprouts. You can microwave them in the bag it comes in. But we roast it in the oven coated with olive oil, garlic salt and pepper. You can add dried cranberries and chopped pecans or walnuts in the final 8 minutes to make it really special. One of my kids would not eat Brussels sprouts if not for these. He would never pick through each and pull off half the leaves and chop off the stems. But he eats them frequently because of the convenience. Try these! But beware. You may never buy whole sprouts again.",
