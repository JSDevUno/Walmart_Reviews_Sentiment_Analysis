I wasn't buying the box for spinach I was buying it for the arugula which was almost non-existent. It was such a poor example it shouldn't even be sold as an arugula/spinach mix, it's not an honest representation. Frankly I've gotten more arugula in a spring salad mix.

My last purchase was 11-13-2018. All the veggies were dripping wet and limp. Nasty is the best description. This is the second straight package that has been like this. It looks like they have quit spin drying the veggies after washing and now they are sealed inside package wet and are just plain disgusting. My advice to Walmart is, find out why these salads used to be so fresh, crisp, and dry with nary a trace of water inside the package.
