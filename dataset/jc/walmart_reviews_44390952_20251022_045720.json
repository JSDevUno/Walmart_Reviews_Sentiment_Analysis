      "review_text": "If you're anything like me, you get a little too excited when you spot fresh asparagus at the store. I mean, who can resist those vibrant green stalks? So, I grabbed a bunch of these freshly harvested guys, and let me tell you, they were perfect for grilling! I tossed them on the grill with just a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, and oh boy, did they sizzle! There's just something magical about the smoky flavor that hugs those asparagus like a long-lost friend. No funky taste here—just pure green goodness! Honestly, every bite was delicious, and I found myself wondering why I hadn't made this a regular thing. If you're into veggies that aren't plotting against your taste buds, these are a must-try. No “yuckies” in sight, just straight-up deliciousness. Perfect for summer barbecues or a fancy dinner (or breakfast, hey, no judgment here!). So grab a bunch, fire up that grill, and prepare to be a veggie hero!",

I had him go back and get the other 10 cans that were missing. why can someone not count? There is a big difference in 2 cans to 12 cans. I checked my whole order before leaving with him there to make sure all was correct. How many people just pull up and leave that dont check their orders to pay for stuff they don't even get. I missed the dog food right away. I had an order that was around 245.00 . people need to be accountable that pulls this items puting they got them when clearly they don't. They just put it in and go on. This is not good working performance on that person abitilty to do their job. The last 2 orders i had delivered, i got all my stuff but the bell peppers had bad spits on them. They dont check.",
