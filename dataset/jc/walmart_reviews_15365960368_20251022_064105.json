It is a really nice sweater for the money. I think it will snag VERY easily, but at this price point, you can't be too mad when it does. I will likely order in other colors. I bought the cream, and it will look nice with tan pants and jeans.",

The yarn wasn't broken or cut, but it wasn't going to fit back into the waffle knit with a simple tug, either. Luckily, I crochet, so I used a small crochet hook to weave the snag back into the knit. I can clearly see where it was done, but most folks probably won't be able to identify the spot. Still...why would this item be shipped without notifying the customer of the flaw? I would have canceled the order if I had known I wasn't getting an intact item, even at the Clearance price.
