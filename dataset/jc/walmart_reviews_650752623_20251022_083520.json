      "review_text": "This may sound silly, but trying to find a mini fridge without bold company logos on the front is difficult because some are really tacky and that bothers me. I wanted a small black fridge with a gold handle. I bought this one, and purchased a gold handle with an adhesive backing that arrives tomorrow. This should have a “clean but custom” look. The dimensions are perfect for one person. I cut out a shelf in my loft to set this at the right height. The bottom part back is intended to be open. I see complaints from these small fridges that they are missing the “back.” The back is intended to face the wall and gives the compressor breathing room. Hard to tell from the photos but there is 19 inches behind the fridge. The item arrived with zero dents and cooled down completely the same night. I don't hear it at all, so I would say it's very quiet. The space is perfect for late-night snacks and any “go-to” items without having to go downstairs. The only thing that could be better is the energy efficiency. This is rated a (2) so it will cost more to run annually than a higher rating. All in all, I love the fridge, and it was a good purchase",

      "review_text": "I just plugged it in today and so far it is working fine and getting cold. The mini freezer compartment seems to get very cold as well (my little thermometer in the picture I brought in from outside to test it says about 20° F). Started getting cold almost immediately after plugging it in. So so far I'm satisfied with how cold it's getting which is why I bought it because I had just bought a smaller “personal chiller” from a different brand that did not get cold enough so I had to take that one back. The only issue I'm having with it which was present before plugging in is that it is unbalanced so it tips over a little whenever I open it. It seems that one of the 4 feet/legs on the bottom 4 corners of the fridge must be slightly shorter than the others. It is annoying but so far not causing too much issue. It's also not too loud in my opinion. It does make noise but it is not constant. It gets a little louder after it's been open for a minute and probably the compressor/machine or something needs to work to keep it cool (idk how fridges work lol) so that is the loudest part but again, that specific noise is not constant. I think it does make some noise though. If the Walmart website lets me I will update if anything changes but so far so good after only a day.",

Except the holes don't line up properly. For starters the holes on the other side were filled with foam, and the foam sprayed out, so I had to scrape it away to find said holes. Then after moving all the hardware over, the top holes are drilled a tad too close to the front. This causes the door to not close tightly. I had to put everything back to the other side.

It's quieter than I imagined, and it really keeps things ice cold. The shelves on the door use movable metal rods to keep drinks in place. It works well, but if you put a bottle of wine where the 2-liter soda bottle goes, there will be some movement/rattling when opening and closing the door. I really wish this came with a mini ice tray to save me another shopping trip, but other than that I'm enjoying my ice cold drinks from this whisper quiet compact fridge.",

Most of them had a warming feature as well and I did not want that since this was for my kids room. I got this Hisense for 89 bucks flat, and it is amazing. There is a ton of space, a removable glass shelf, and it gets extrememly cold. I have the dial set half way between low and mid, and it keeps all my kids snacks and drinks ice cold. The door is reversible, it's light enough for one adult to move around, and setup was as easy as removing the stickers and plugging it in. I let it run empty for just a few hours then it was good to stock with food and drinks. Its not terribly loud at all, and doesn't run for a long amount of time. This model has a freezer compartment but honestly I haven't tried it out yet. But please note, the user manual says for \"temporary\" storage of frozen items, so I assume they will not stay frozen for a long time.

My issue is that it came damaged, with an 8-inch vertical dent in the middle of the front door. That occurred during transport from the manufacturer to Walmart. They need to do a much better job packaging the item, the heavy card box is NOT enough. They should add a piece of Styrofoam to the front and back to shield it. Over and over, I see many other reviewers experiencing the same damage. Honestly, it's too much of a hassle to return it to the store because the fridge works well.

Cannot put perishable items in it. It has went out again twice today. It’s frustrating! I’m still within my return period and Walmart online cs stated they can’t take it back at the store location without the box and offered me a 25% partial refund. Well ok, I’m still out 75% of my money for a non functioning product. I’ve contacted Hisense bc they have a 1 year warranty and have heard nothing back from them. Absolutely would not recommend this fridge. I should have paid more and gotten a better brand. If you still decide to go with this brand, I would definitely pay extra and get the extended warranty.

If you want to put in a room that has carpeting. I would recommend getting a base for it. The base are pretty inexpensive and you can get them off a amazon. That way the carpeting won't get damaged especially, if you live in a apartment. I unfortunately scratched it. So,I would suggest be careful with it because it does scratch easily. Besides, it is a very quiet and wonderful mini fridge. I would definitely recommend purchasing it.",
