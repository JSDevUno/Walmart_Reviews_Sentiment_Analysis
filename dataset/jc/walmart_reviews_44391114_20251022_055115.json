All in all there are very few bargains in Walmart beside they are always out of stock on groceries. Also they have no way to communicate with the customer so you can't tell them make sure everything is fresh or if they're out of something text the shopper to pick up an alternate...BUT WALMART HAS NO PLACE TO SELECT REPLACEMENTS AND IF YOU TRY %26 TEXT THE SHOPPER THEY DON'T RESPOND!

Large, fresh, affordable, and reliably in stock. But most especially interesting to me, as a former Produce Dept. Manager, it was ingeniously packaged to maximizing use, while avoiding the dreaded tightrope of dehydration -vs- incipient brown slime. The bag has a loose-fitting \"hood\" design, which prevents desiccation, without trapping excess moisture, so it \"breathes.\" As I also wrapped the base in a damp paper towel, a head I'd purchased in late November was still crisp and as fresh as the day we'd purchased it, over six weeks later (although much diminished in size).",
