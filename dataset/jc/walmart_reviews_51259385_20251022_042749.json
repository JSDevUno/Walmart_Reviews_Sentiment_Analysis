      "review_text": "I got a good batch from store pickers in North Las Vegas, NV. One pound fresh in a blue net bag, grown in Mexico, prebagged by Church Brown Farms in Calif., 500 miles away. There are 16 large, firm, dark green Brussels sprouts with tightly clinging outer leaves and are clean (bag reminds \"wash before use\"). They are best roasted but I steamed then sliced them, removing stem ends. Insides are as fresh, firm and clean as outside but lighter color. Made into a salad with quinoa, cashews, lemon juice, oil, and bit of cheese. These were excellent quality on 3/8/2024. Highly recommend this brand. And that you shop the day after your WMT restocks.",
