      "review_text": "We are senior citizens. We had a 31-year-old Amana. We did extensive research to decide on a replacement. Boy, are we happy to have chosen Frigidaire. It is very spacious; the doors can hold a lot of bottled groceries, and the vegetable drawers are high enough to hold a big cabbage or lettuce. I love all the different compartments in the freezer drawer. Every item has its place, eliminating guesswork. More importantly, the appliance fits in the very tight space we had. Thank you Fridgidaire.",

      "review_text": "I bought this model a month ago, and the highlights of this model are: Space Efficiency: This model is designed to fit flush with my pantry, providing a sleek, built-in look, and added space into the kitchen. Large Capacity: Despite its counter-depth design, it offers ample storage with wide shelves and deep drawers, making it ideal for my cooking enthusiasm. Advanced Cooling Technology: Features like EvenTemp™ cooling system ensures consistent temperatures throughout the fridge, reducing freezer burn and keeping food fresh. Energy Efficiency: Frigidaire refrigerators are known for their energy-efficient designs, helping me save on electricity bills while being environmentally friendly. Convenient Features: Additional features like ice makers, and advanced water filtration. I'm still excited about this fridge, but I have a small disappointment regarding the rebate. The 30-inch model I purchased is listed as a non-eligible item, so the rebate is on hold. I'm not sure if I will receive the $100 rebate. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic fridge!",

      "review_text": "I've had this refrigerator since December 10, 2024, and overall, I really like it. It's my first time owning a two-door model with the refrigerator on the bottom, and the storage capacity is more than enough for my needs. Problem: In the past week, I've noticed that the right door doesn't close tightly anymore. I have to push it firmly to make sure it's sealed, as if the magnetic seal isn't holding as well as it used to. I have no idea why this issue suddenly started, so I'll need to check the warranty. Cons: The ice maker makes a terrible noise, so I keep it disabled. Suggested improvements: I would love to see an extra drawer dedicated to cheeses and deli meats, as well as a light inside the freezer.",

Putting in the door shelves was a challenge as they are tight (which means they won't fall out) but we were worried about breaking them since they are plastic and a lot of force is needed to snap them in. The fridge has a lot of space for a 32” but it lacks a dedicated space for eggs - so we just leave them in the cartons. Overall we like the fridge and we doubt it will last as long as our last fridge did - 22 years and still going - but that may be too much to expect - newer appliances don't seem to be made like they were in the past.",

My old fridge came with the house and was well over twenty years old - it was a fabulous fridge and held a LOT of stuff. New fridges now are designed quite differently and seem far less spacious. The things I like most about this fridge is the layout. Without the extra crisper drawer, there is a ton more room to put taller items - all other fridges you are pretty much limited to the door. So far it runs well and is reasonably quiet. I like the counter depth as it blends well and doesn't stick out into the room - though that does compromise somewhat on the holding capacity, which is fine for my home. I would have preferred to not have the ice maker as I can't connect to water and it's a waste of space. The freezer drawer layout works well though, and it's nice to organize the compartments. Overall it's a great fridge and I'm very pleased with it.",

If you need to pull out your fridge because it is in a close out on both sides, you can't without removing the side wall/close out. Every other fridge I have owned has at least 1.5X longer power cord. It is a little small inside (not very deep) especially if you don't utilize the door storage. There is no light in the freezer area, but it's something you can get used to. Freezer area space is also pretty limited by the ice maker taking up space in the top left corner and the ice catcher. All that said, it is working well, fairly quiet and seemingly reliable if the power cord length is not an issue for your kitchen set up",

This simple interior design is perfect, 3 large shelves that go from side to side. The only downside that isnt really a downside in there are only 2 crispers. So I added my own clear plastic basket to just help organize things. The doors hold quite a bit more than what they look like they hold. Exterior is quick to clean with soap and water and finger prints come right off. Not bad for too many fingers prints either. The freezer is compartmentalized which I love. I have a bigger freezer so now I can keep everything organized that I use more frequently in this freezer and no exactly where to look for an item. This fridge says in the specs that it is smaller than my last fridge but because of the way it's laid out it is actually bigger, I have way more room.

It looks good, the temperature is stable (nothing freezes in the fridge portion), and it's quiet. My only issue is the French doors - the left door has a folding flap that sometimes hits the other door. I don't know if I'm accidentally moving it to cause this, but a few times I've hit the other door and had to adjust the flap to get the door closed. The other issue is that the doors need to be pushed closed - you can't let them glide closed on their own. Overall I'm happy with my purchase, I just wish the doors were engineered a bit better.",

Just a design feature not fully thought out.

My previous refrigerator only made noise when ice cubes fell into the storage tray.The size is adequate for our requirements, but it may be too small for a family. But I do have a concern. When we open the freezer drawer, both refrigerators make a clunking noise that makes us think something has broken. I'm not sure what that is, but hopefully Frigidaire will address it.

We were just talking to the new owners, and they also have had no issues with our appliances. 7 years ago, we sold our farm and moved to a smaller property. It was exactly what we were looking for execpt one thing. The appliances were not Frigidaire.

My wife, with an ice pick in her hand—yes, that was a scene straight out of a suspense thriller. Fast forward to our current culinary masterpiece, and it's a different story. This unit is not just a pretty face; it's a marvel of efficiency. It's so quiet that I had to double-check it was running and not just posing as a refrigerator. And let's talk about the lighting—brighter than my future after I stopped the daily ice pick adventures.

The freezer drawer is difficult to pull out, but I do like the way the freezing compartment is organized.",

      "review_text": "Great fridge. Well lit. Purchased the fridge a month ago. So far so good. Last one was a 2011 model making loud noises. Same manufacturer. This one makes quieter noises, and seems to have better regulation/control over the compressor. Nice clean lines, easy install. Good handles. Magnetic surface despite stainless steel finish is a bonus. The finish does scratch with certain magnets fairly easily so those have been moved to the side of the fridge. Not sure how that can be avoided with a metal surface though. It is arranged well, though door shelves were a little tight to install, I am worried the plastic might break if I attempt to take them out and move around. So try to think about where to put them as you set up the door shelves. Doors all seem to have a good seal. The left door is the one with the... vertical flapper bar? that the right door rests on to make a seal in the middle, between the two doors. This flapper thing sometimes pops out a little far when you only open the left door and try to close it, hitting the right door. I sometimes have to poke the flapper to let the door close, not really a big deal but can be annoying. I hope that over time the flap will get worn-in and stop popping out as much. It does seem to be happening less over time. We'll see. The freezer drawer/door has a good seal. It makes kind of a loud pop whenever I open it. As the seal releases. Not sure how normal that is. Almost seems to be magnetically assisted when closing. But no issues so far. Hopefully good for another 250,000 pulls! The energy rating was an important factor in fridge selection. This one was a little better than most of the similar size. I have to admit, beyond spending a lot more for an ultra efficient fridge, they all seemed pretty similar in the price range. I liked that this unit actually had its energy rating easily visible on all the sites it was listed on. I like it. I would recommend.",

      "review_text": "I bought this refrigerator a month ago to replace a 30\" Whirlpool refrigerator which was brand new as well but didn't work well from day 1. The problem I had with the Whirlpool was that the temperature uniformity from one shelf to another varied greatly where the top shelf would be 44°F (which is not food safe, and the crisper drawers would be 30°F which would freeze my veggies. So I retired the Whirlpool and went with the Frigidaire and I'm so glad I did. The temperature uniformity with this fridge is excellent. The temperature is the same on every shelf and in the crisper drawers. The simple layout in the interior of this fridge is far better than the Whirlpool I returned and, even though the Frigidaire is smaller by 1.5 cuft there is actually more useable space in this fridge. This ice maker makes ice quickly, the interior light in the fridge is a nice cool color, and the outside of the fridge is sleek. Not to mention the door baskets are well constructed, sturdy, and have good storage space. The freezer is a good space and the addition of drawers inside the freezer is a nice addition which I wasn't sure if I would like but I love them. They are great for keeping meat, fish, etc from frozen fruit or bread and the ice being enclosed in a drawer is nice as well so it doesn't impart flavors from other foods in the freezer. The only thing I'd like to see from this fridge would be an internal water dispenser and a light in the freezer but these are minor issues. All in all I highly recommend this refrigerator. Especially if you are in need of a 30\" refrigerator.",

      "review_text": "Our old fridge died recently so we made a quick decision to buy this model based on its dimensions to fit into our narrow kitchen. This fridge is small (in a good way), easy to maneuver, and surprisingly lightweight. The top refrigerator unit is deep and wide with shelves to move around and deep door shelves to maximize. It's almost too much space which is not a bad thing! Temperature control is digital and easy to use for both the fridge and freezer underneath. Speaking of the freezer, it's bigger than you think it is at first glance. The main drawer fits everything perfectly where, in our old vertical freezer, took up so much space. But that's not all, the second drawer pulls out above the main drawer and has even more space and contains the easy-to-access ice maker with a scoop! The things that make me happy in my thirties... Anyway, there's also a third drawer that pulls out and I can't be more thankful for this design. You can pull out each drawer on its own and close them all together when you're finished. The whole unit runs fairly quietly. My only complaint is closing the left side door. There's a flap that locks into place when you close the left side first then the right. However, if you close the right first and then the left, the flap often stops you from closing the door without manually flattening it and closing it again. Startles me every time I don't close the fridge \"properly.\" I'll get used to it. Overall, I'm so thankful for this unit.",

I do enjoy having the fridge on top but find the freezer too big and the fridge small. I have a full size freezer in the basement so only need freezer space for ice and ice cream. The crispers are smaller than my previous ones too. I also miss having a drawer for meat and cheese. I keep milk on the shelf as it does not stay cold enough in the door bin. (First jug went bad in a couple of days) another shelf might help to give more room but I don't know if it is possible to order one? It is a nice enough fridge and working well so far but but for the price i feel could be designed better. Anyone buying should pay attention to how much space it actually has.",

Despite this fridge being nearly the same measurements as our previous one, it seems to have way more room in it and we like the configuration of this one much more.
