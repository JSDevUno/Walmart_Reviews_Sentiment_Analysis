      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently purchased this small refrigerator, for my almost 100-year-old house! Finding an appliance that fits compact space leaves me with very few options. This fridge, however, almost slid in perfectly but I did have to remove the solid oak vintage trim to get it in there. A plus for me was the reversible door feature. Being able to choose whether it opens to the left or right made all the difference in making it work. Honestly, I don't need my fridge to communicate with me or send text. My only real complaint, and it's a bit of an ongoing one, is that the freezer door tends to pop open whenever I close the main fridge door. I do have to remember to give the freezer a quick check each time to make sure it's sealed properly, so I don't end up with an unexpected thaw. The other thing I miss is a meat drawer. Overall, if you're in a similar situation with limited space or an older home, this fridge is definitely worth considering. Just be mindful of that freezer door!",

The only drawback is if you want to move a shelf up or down - even if nothing is blocking the door it only opens less than 180* so pulling out a shelf is a very tight squeeze.

Since there are only three of us now, we wanted to downsize a bit but didn't want to compromise on features. The Whirlpool 14 cubic foot refrigerator with top freezer was the perfect fit for our needs and had all the features we wanted: top freezer, glass shelves in the refrigerator section, door storage, etc. We are all very happy with this purchase and look forward to many years of service from this appliance.

Compared to some other well known brands, the first thing I noticed was the excellent parts and overall construction of this model refrigerator (i.e. all the aluminum plating over the copper coils, this is a plus considering the refrigerator I replaced had cardboard over the coil area, also, the seals on the doors work extremely well In addition to being very energy efficient.) I also noticed Whirlpool added internal vents from the freezer to the refrigeration area, which is probably one of the reasons this model has excellent refrigeration. Although, this refrigerator has three shelves and two drawers at the bottom, I wish they had included a small drawer to the left under the initial top shelf. I'm pretty sure there is room for it, however, I've been able to adapt and I am not disappointed. The freezer seemed perfect, but wished they included a couple of ice cube trays. I guess I'm old fashioned that way. The refrigerator also included a five year warranty and for the price, I believe this was an excellent purchase. Thank you Whirlpool.",

Fortunately, it was covered under our 1 year warranty. Now, less than a year later, we are experiencing the exact same problems. Of course, it is no longer on warranty. Was told when I bought this frig by the salmon that it is hit and miss. I was hoping for the best. Well seems like we had a miss.

We found a good replacement with this model: the shelves are not as rigid as I would like but they are easy to rearrange. The shelf barriers are a good sturdy design. The door seals well and the temperature gauge is easy to reach. We find that we waste less food due to the appropriate size of this model. It's a very reliable product. My son certainly thinks so.",

I liked the glass shelves and separate controls for fridge and freezer. It arrived factory-set to almost perfect temperatures, cooled quickly and stays very consistent. I don't hear it running and the lighting inside is quite bright. Three weeks later, a storm left us without power for 42 hours. Food was still cold after 24 hours! I moved frozen food to a freezer powered by a generator and used an ice chest for things like milk and mayo. After the power was restored, I was stunned to find the few items left in the fridge were still fairly cold and there were still ice cubes (although wet) in their trays in the freezer! I'm very happy with this purchase.The only thing that would make it better is if there was a drawer for storing meat/cheese, even if it was optional.",
