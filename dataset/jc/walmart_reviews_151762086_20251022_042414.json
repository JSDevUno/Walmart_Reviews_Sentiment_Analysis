I can't believe I'm 55 years old and never knew an apple could be so juicy and sweet. When you take a bite, be prepared for the juices to start sprouting out everywhere. Seriously.. you might want to keep a safe distance from people. It's better to be safe than sorry. Also, it would be wise to have a paper towel or napkin handy. These fresh honeycrisp apples are definitely worth the extra money. You'll never like another one better, and you might even start to crave them. Yes, these mouth-watering apples are that good!",

The person who answered the phone in the online order department was very apologetic and helpful in getting my refund but while the person who picked the order for me should pay much better attention to the quality of the produce they choose, Walmart of Russellville bears some blame in keeping such a poor watch over the produce they are offering customers. These apples didn't go this bad overnight. They have been sitting in a produce bin rotting more and more for days. In the picture, note the juice in the corner of the bag and the rotten apple squashed on top of the bottom apple. There are at least 6 more apples in the bag that are in various stages of totally rotten.",

Here's a quick breakdown: The apples were noticeably smaller than average, which isn't a dealbreaker on its own—but it did raise eyebrows. They also looked overly ripe, with some showing soft spots and blemishes right out of the bag. Flavor was lacking. Instead of the bright, sweet-tart punch you'd expect from a good apple, these tasted dull and flat. There was none of that refreshing crispness that makes apples such a satisfying snack. These apples felt like they were past their prime before they even hit the shelf. If you're after quality produce, you might want to skip this bag and opt for picking apples individually—or better yet, visit a local orchard or farmers market.",

Taste wasn’t even that great either. I made sure to rinse them well, so it didn’t taste like soap or anything, but it was bleh and super bland. My ADHD is super bad and I kept forgetting to message them about it. I assume it’s been too long so send them a complaint. So, I sadly probably can’t get a refund.
