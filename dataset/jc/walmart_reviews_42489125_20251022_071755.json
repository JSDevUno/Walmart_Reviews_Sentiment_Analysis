I had the idea to use two tension rods as a sort of shelf for bins holding some of our very light/ seasonal items to take advantage of the storage. These were easy to figure out. I bought them in store, so no damage. Of course, I wouldn't put a crazy amount of weight, but they did the job! Make sure you buy tension rods with a larger max range than you need and keep the tension as tight to the wall as possible and they work great! I will be soon ordering longer ones for our bedroom closet.",
