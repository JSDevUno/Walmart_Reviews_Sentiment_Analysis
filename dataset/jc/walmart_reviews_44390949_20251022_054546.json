On my last order dated June 8, I was informed that I would NOT receive the following items from my order due to cancellation. I didn't understand. Just assumed you were OUT OF STOCK of the items and also any substitutions. The items were listed as: Zucchini, bananas, avocadoes, onions, chicken breast, and portabella mushrooms. I am very happy to report that every single item was delivered. And the man doing the delivering had even checked my dozen eggs and reported that one was broken. That was a first for us and very kind and unexpected as I once had 8 out of 18 eggs broken and it was NOT reported to us nor compensated.",

The Avocados I received earlier in the year were the best ever. They were from Mexico. Why did Walmart switch from those from Mexico which were perfect this year, to the Colombian avocados? I even ordered some from different Walmart stores to see if I could get a good avocado. They were all bad....horrible.... Could not eat any part of them.

These bad boys are forged in the fires of Mount Doom by orcs and hardened to a density that makes diamonds look like marshmallows. I ordered them for pickup and they were obviously chosen with tremendous care — by someone who thinks avocados should double as spare parts for battleships and a desire to break teeth when someone bites into a lovely taco. At this point, I'm not waiting for guacamole — I'm waiting for the Avengers to show up and use them as weapons. It's been one week. Seven full days. These avocados remain resolutely unripe, impervious, and suspiciously dense. I'm not sure whether I bought produce or received a classified shipment of depleted-uranium slugs for the USS Zumwalt's rail gun. 88 cents each rather than $1.3 million per round. Either way, they are not for spreading on toast — they are for ballistic testing. The Ukraine could win against the Russians with these all before the first one ripens. So, to the Walmart grocery picker who lovingly hand-selected these emerald artillery shells for me: I see you. I know what you did. Somewhere between the display bin and my pickup order, you thought, “This guy doesn't deserve guacamole. He deserves geological samples.” Well played. My nachos are crying, my toast is barren, and I'm now the proud owner of produce better suited for naval warfare than taco night. Bravo. 🥑💣👏",

      "review_text": "I am giving 5 stars for this order of avocados only. These are big and fresh. Not only do they look great, the color inside is gorgeous, and they taste amazing. I would also like to thank the person who shopped my order. You did an amazing job! I regularly order avocados and up until this order, I've been debating going somewhere else. Sometimes, it looks as if Wal-mart's personal shoppers don't pay any attention to the produce they pick for customers. The last several times I've ordered avocados, they've been gross; brown and greenish inside, squishy on the outside, I've had to throw some out. A person with some sense would know that it should've been tossed out, not used for an order. I don't know who will be reading this, but if it's a consumer please be cautious when ordering. If this review goes straight to Wal-Mart, my suggestion is; you should have a competent person training your personal shoppers so no one has to put up with this. I realize you guys are great about refunding money on items that are spoiled and/or for items that your shoppers forgot to shop for and we didn't get them, but that's not the point. There is a reason a certain item was asked for, and when your shoppers can't tell the difference between fresh and rotten there's a problem. It totally screws up whatever we had planned, whether we need an item for a last minute event or just for dinner, we should be able to have confidence in the aptitude of your employees. I was thinking, maybe add a texting feature so the shopper can take a picture of the item and say \"Hey, I noticed these avocados are super small, did you still want them?\" Or take a pic and send it to ensure the customer is happy with the looks of a certain produce item. Also it would be nice if we could text the shopper and tell them how we like our produce or whatever the item may be. Having good communication is key. I know shoppers for other companies can do this. The only texting feature I have is with the person who is delivering my order. It's only helpful if they are lost, other than that it has nothing to do with the shopping part. I hope this helps.",

It feels like nobody at Walmart cares about protecting fresh produce. If you're ordering fruit from them, don't be surprised if you're left with barely half the amount you paid for.

When a person is buying salad items, they need a usable avocado, NOT one that is rock hard. When this happens, either my produce goes bad while waiting for the avocado to ripen, or I end up just eating my salad without it. Then, when it finally starts to soften, it seems like it becomes a combination of rock hard and rotten. I don't purchase these from Walmart anymore.

First, the value is absolutely incredible. I consistently find them for up to $1 OFF each compared to other grocery stores, which adds up to massive savings for an avocado lover like me. Second, the quality is remarkably consistent. I don't get the rock-hard or already-mushy frustration anymore; they ripen perfectly every single time into that dreamy, creamy green goodness. And finally, the size! These are not the puny, disappointing avocados you sometimes find. They're a great, substantial size—one is perfect for two slices of toast or a generous portion of guacamole. If you want fantastic quality, great size, and unbelievable value, you simply cannot beat these Fresh Hass Avocados. 10/10 recommend",

When perfectly ripe, they yield gently to pressure, offering that ideal buttery consistency without being stringy or bruised inside. They're incredibly versatile; whether I'm mashing them for a vibrant guacamole, slicing them to top a spicy taco, or dicing them for a refreshing salsa, they always add a layer of luxuriousness. Beyond their delicious taste, these avocados are also a fantastic source of healthy fats and nutrients, making them a guilt-free indulgence.

Disappointing because it causes the flavor to be off. Sad part is you either get way under ripe produce or rotten produce...recent watermelon was the same way - nice green, nice thump...but cutting into it 3 days later, it was so pale and actually tasted unripe. Bananas, if you get a bunch, sure you can help ripen some of them, but others are more stubborn. Then, when they do come of age, you have to do something with the entire lot, or else they will go bad before you get them all eaten. Sheesh...lol",
