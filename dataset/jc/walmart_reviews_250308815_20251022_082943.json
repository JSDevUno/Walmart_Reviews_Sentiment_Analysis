      "title": "Awesome small chest freezer",
      "review_text": "We purchased this through the app at our local Wal-Mart. We wanted a small chest freezer for frozen foods storage, and this one is perfect. It's just my husband and myself here, as our children are all adults. This is the perfect size freezer for a couple or small family. It's actually the second one that I have putchased, but my original one was left behind on the west coast when I moved. I had been so impressed with that one that I purchased another. I did notice that some of the reviews mentioned receiving a damaged item. My advice is to purchase it at your local store if possible. Sometimes delivery services such as UPS or FedEx aren't exactly gentle with their deliveries. A Wal-Mart employee was able to fit it in the back of my Chevy Blazer without any problem.",

      "title": "I love my FREEZER Five Stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
      "review_text": "Five Stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I absolutely LOVE my deep freezer! As a small business owner running a home bakery, this is goaded for me. I definitely needed the extra freezer space, and it did not disappoint. I’ve seen so many bad reviews about dents and damages, so I was nervous. But let me tell you—mine arrived in perfect condition. No dents, no scratches, nothing. It even came super fast! I ordered mine at 2 a.m., and it was delivered by 10 a.m. the same day. I wasn’t even expecting it until later that night, so that was a pleasant surprise. If you’re debating whether to buy this—buy it! Run and get it. It gets cold fast. I turned mine on, and within 30 minutes, it was already really cold. It has different settings (minimum, mid, and max), and of course, I set mine to max because I need my treats frozen solid. The size is perfect. It’s actually bigger than I expected—about 4 feet wide and 3.5 feet tall—so there’s plenty of space. It also comes with a small tray at the top, which is perfect for organizing. I added small bins inside to keep my treats separate from my regular food, which helps keep everything organized and clean. The price? $165. I hesitate to spend over $100 on anything, but this was worth it. You also get a one-year warranty, so make sure to fill out that paperwork! And let’s be real—who wants to haul a freezer home from the store when Walmart delivers it for free once you spend over $35? I know how hard it is to find honest reviews because some people just love to bash companies, making it impossible to tell if something is actually good or not. But this is my honest experience, and I hope this helps someone who’s been debating like I was. I’ll update this review in a week, but so far—five stars all the way!",

      "review_text": "This product was ordered for my grandmother and delivered to her address at the time. It is a senior citizen living apartments. The order was delayed for about 4 days. I literally have emails saying your order will be delivered today and other emails sayings, we are sorry for the delay it was taken back to the warehouse. This happened about four different times. By the time it was delivered to my grandmother, it was damaged. The whole front side was damage, it was cracked at the top and it had dents in it. This was completely unacceptable and the only reason my grandmother kept it was because she said it worked. She's older and didn't want to go through the worry that comes with filing a compliant. Whoever delivered it, literally left it right at her front door. I would have thought, that maybe they would have the common decency to at least knock on her door and take it in. Nothing more, after all she is a senior and she has to walk with a cane to keep her mobility. Since it was above their pay rate, they kept going. My grandmother is in her 70s and had to ask the rent office for help. How was she suppose to get it on the inside of her apartment? The only reason I'm saying something today is because, I am just now thinking about it again. I couldn't get to my grandmother until days later, way after the delivery. There is no excuse for how long the delivery took or the deep freezer being damaged before it arrived. I would love for someone to reach out to me to talk to me.",

Walmart issued the refund, added the same product to my cart, and asked me to place a new order. I placed the new order on August 19, 2024, with a scheduled delivery date of August 22. However, on August 21, I still hadn’t received any shipment update. When I contacted the Walmart agent, I was informed that it was unlikely I would receive the product by the expected date. By this time, I had already received over 200 lbs of frozen food delivered to my home, which I now have to throw out.

Again, the reviews don’t lie. The freezer so far is working but I did not pay for dents. Lesson learned!!!! They offered me a slight discount and credit but they should be ashamed of themselves.

      "review_text": "The freezer works fine once set up, but I need to warn people: when I first opened it in my garage (before even plugging it in), I was blasted with the worst chemical offgassing I've ever experienced. Didn't expect a literal wall of VOCs to hit me in the face. One deep breath and immediately I had issues breathing. It persisted days after. I'm a young adult, healthy, and don't have asthma or any breathing problems, so for it to have affected me that long shows just how strong the offgassing was. There was no warning label about ventilation. Without airing it out first, all those toxic chemicals just get sealed in with your food. I wouldn't risk that, especially with long-term storage. This is preventable so it's just manufacturing laziness from companies to not air out ahead of time. If you're sensitive to breathing in harmful chemicals, have asthma, or even enjoy breathing, DO NOT open this in a closed room. I recommend letting it sit outside for a full day, wiping everything down, and leaving baking soda trays inside before plugging it in The design's solid for the price, but zero points for user safety or transparency. Would be 5 stars if they included an offgassing warning at the very least, but really customers should not have to worry about this.",

      "review_text": "The unit cooled quickly, stores quite a bit of groceries, and is housed in my kitchen easily. My issues? Firstly, delivery from Walmart came a day and a half after ordering in-store pick-up. With my delivery driver blaming me for the heaviness of the product ordered and not being to remove the product from the store’s drop-off list. The unit itself also came with a four inch dent on the upper left hand side of the lid. I’ll be keeping the unit and devising a way to disguise the dent. Plus, I ordered the 5.0 cubic foot unit and received the 7.0 unit; not a bad exchange for most. Yet, I needed the smaller footprint for a smaller home. In all, the unit has cooled off quickly, is easy to unwrap, wipes off well, and will seemingly last for some time to come. Do I wish it came without a dent? Yes. Am I hauling it back to my local Walmart? No. Do I wish I had been able to pick-up the freezer at my local store three days ago when the order was initially placed? You bet. Especially, after having to haul the freezer up my driveway, by myself, in the Mississippi heat. I’m grateful for the device. I’m keeping it. But please be advised that your unit will likely arrive dented. If prestige is your goal, look elsewhere. Or prepare to haul your unit back to your local Walmart.",

All I can say is that it came without any dents, unlike for several reviewers, and it got cold quickly after turning it on. I have to have it set to minimum for it to not get colder than I want, but that's ok, I guess. I hope it will last a long time. It does NOT seem like it is truly energy efficient, though, even though the manufacturer claims it is. It uses nearly twice the wattage (as measured via P3 kilowatt device) as my 1-year-old Frigidaire (they are the same size and style of freezer) does when set to stay at the same temperature as one another. If I had to do it over again, I would have gotten another Frigidaire for that reason, but I don't think I could get this freezer in my car to return it.",

None that I could find. Now I need to load it, drive it back to the store, unload it, take it in, only then figure out a solution. It works just fine and I needed it quickly. I will keep it and explore factory options if any. My time is worth something as is everyone else's. It's not worth the cost of time vrs the cost of the product to put any more effort in the problem. So I recommend you physically unbox it at the store during pickup with an associate there. That way the swap out time is minimal and you get what you paid for!",

My freezer on my fridge went out but the refrigerator part still works, and I love it so I decided to go with this until I can save up to buy a new one as the one I want is on a champagne taste on a beer budget lol It was plugged in no more than an hour and was so cold I had to turn it down a bit. I had some pickle pops in there and they were rock hard lol So it def gets cold, quick Only complaint, and not sure I can blame Walmart for this, is the little dent on the front bottom by the drain plug that chipped the paint. If the paint weren’t chipped I wouldn’t mind, but we all know what that chipped paint will lead to. I’m going to get some clear nail polish or sealer and go over it so hopefully it don’t spread and/or rust. Otherwise I’m very very happy",

I would of called them to come pick it back up if there was any damage to the box, but the box had no imperfections at all so I figured I had received an undamaged product. NOT SO. My husband was out of town for a couple of weeks so I was unable to open it for awhile and took another week so he could run a direct electric line to it. Once opened, it had a large dent that went from the front to the side. How could this happen with a perfectly unmarred box? Is the company taking their returns and reboxing them?? I looked all over for a phone number to call Walmart to lodge my complaint, but all you can talk to is a computer and there is no area to talk about damages. Will this dent void the extra warranty I paid for from Walmart? I went ahead and plugged it in and have monitored the temperature for 2 weeks now and it seems to be running fine even with the dent. I don't really care about the dent as the freezer is in a place that only the family can see, but I do believe I am due a discount due to the damage. Should I have to pay full price for a damaged freezer? I like the freezer. It is the perfect size for us so I gave only 3 stars due to the way it was delivered by Walmart and because of the manufacturer's attempt at trying to hide the damage by reboxing.",

Overall I'm very pleased with this little freezer, great price, its has a small footprint, (I'm in a apartment).

To top it off I contact support they gave me a promo code of $15 instead of fixing the issue itself . What's $15 compared to almost $200 in price and shipping .
