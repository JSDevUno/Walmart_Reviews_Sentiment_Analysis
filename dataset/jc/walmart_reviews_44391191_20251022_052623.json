The skin was able to be slid off of some parts. It had no mold or mildew, but smelled strongly of something distinctly chemical. Knowing that some people like papaya and others don't, I tried it. Tasted like I was chewing latex gloves. I'm going to have to take lessons on this fruit. In the meantime, I won't order when they don't send them closer to their use by date. If I order Papaya today, I want to enjoy it this week, not get them in varying stages of ripeness and/or decay. If you were looking to use the seeds, there were nowhere near the amount in the advertised image. I thing it yielded three tablespoons.",
