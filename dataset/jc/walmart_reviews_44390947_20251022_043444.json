There it was, shimmering under the kitchen light like it had descended directly from the Garden of Eden. I half expected a choir of angels to start humming. The firmness? Divine. The shade of green? A hue that can only be described as “photosynthesis chic.” I held it in my hand and whispered, “You complete me.” But here's the thing about zucchini: it's versatile. You can grill it, sauté it, spiralize it into noodles, or just stare at it longingly like I did for an uncomfortable amount of time before cooking it. I sliced it, and the sound was like the soft crunch of snow underfoot in a winter forest. Pure magic. When I finally ate it, I swear time slowed down. My taste buds signed a thank-you card. My ancestors applauded from beyond. Even my cat paused mid-nap to acknowledge the greatness that was unfolding. In short: this zucchini didn't just feed my body - it nourished my soul. If you're on the fence about buying a zucchini, let this be your sign. This isn't a vegetable. It's a lifestyle.",

I make large batches of soups and spaghetti and I freeze separate containers in my deep freezer for quick meals. I did not realize that for some reason the squash from here tastes extremely bitter as if it is not at all ripe even though it appears ripe. I could not figure out why my spaghetti has a bitter taste and then it happened again with my soup. I haven't been feeling well so I kept wondering if I had done something wrong or forgot something but I could not imagine what could have had this big impact. Yesterday I cut squash into spears and seasoned it and cooked it on it's own and when I ate it I immediately knew something was seriously wrong. I also immediately recognized it as the flavor I had been tasting in my spaghetti and soup. These batches of soups and spaghetti are made in huge stock pots and they usually cost $75-125 a batch. They usually last me 6 months or so. You can imagine how frustrating it is to be reminded every time I pull out a container for dinner. I am tempted to throw it all away and make a new batch but I am haunted by how much food will be wasted and the sheer cost all because the quality of the vegetables here is horrible.",
