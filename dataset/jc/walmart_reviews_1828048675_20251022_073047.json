The instructions said to lay it flat for 3 days. I did and it was fine and very soft. I was nervous it would shed but it didn't. The backing was soft rubber like a bath mat so I had concerns that it would pull up when being vacuumed. Nope. Both rugs were for our odd shaped bedroom with the larger going under our bed. I had intended to lay it vertically with the long side going from top of the bed to the bottom. Once we felt how nice and soft the fur was, we decided to lay it the short way to allow a larger amount to step on getting out of the bed. Truly impressed and believe me I tried to find fault.",

It's very soft but, it's more like a big throw that you would put on your couch or bed. There's no padding or structure to the \"rug\" just a very soft fabric to try to control. I say that because the fabric doesn't want to spread smoothly. It's not a rug, it's a very soft spread. I wanted to return it but it was more trouble to get it out from under my bedframe and than into a vacum bag and fitting into a box. No, I kept it and I'm careful not to trip over the big ripples and waves in the fabric.",

I was utterly disappointed. We cannot use or keep this rug. Our previous rug cost far less and offered unbeatable quality, bounce and durability. That is what I thought I was getting. Alas, it's not even 24 hours since it arrived. It's got a roundtrip ticket to WalMartville. Bye bye baby. Sorry you weren't what I was expecting. But the pink fur was pretty to look at. That's all.",

The rug is incredibly soft and plush, making it perfect for lounging or adding a cozy touch to any room. The gray color is a versatile neutral that complements a variety of decor styles, from modern to traditional. The size is ideal for a larger living room or bedroom, covering ample space without feeling overwhelming. It's also well-made, with no shedding or loose threads, which was a concern I had with fluffy rugs in the past. The non-slip backing is a bonus, keeping it securely in place even on hardwood floors. Overall, this rug is a great blend of comfort, quality, and style. If you're looking to add a soft, luxurious feel to your home, I highly recommend it!",
