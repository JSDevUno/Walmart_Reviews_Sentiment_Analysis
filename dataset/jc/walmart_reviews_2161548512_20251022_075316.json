The Walmart price for 2 of these mirrors was $14, pretty much a no-brainer. Granted that this was a featured discount, but it worked for me! I did have to buy a few other items to reach the minimum purchase amount, but there's always something I need around the house or for my residential real estate business.",

There is NO warping or \"Fun House\" effect...being 75 \"ain't no picnic to look at\", but it's a fine mirror! Every so often I try looking my best and being in a wheelchair made it quite difficult to use the bathroom mirror OR the one in my compact.

He then told me that i would have to buy a box %26 bubble wrap, but they didn't have a size for the mirror. Therefore, I would need to buy a larger box, and the total would be approximately $35.00 to ship it back for the return. Needless to say, I was not going to spend $35.00 to return an item that was less than $9.00.",

I only knew because the driver took pic of the delivery for proof of delivery so I could see that they just dropped them off at the most convenient place (Dick's Sporting) instead of finding my store in the mall. I had even called the driver who didn't answer to tell him where my store was located as well as sent a chat message. They still did not respond to either. This was 12 full length mirrors and they were delivered unboxed, unwrapped, unprotected and without any labeling on them to indicate what store they belonged to and they were left at the checkout desk at front door of Dick's in a shopping cart. Luckily the Dick's store manager took my phone call about them and secured them for me until I could pick them up. Poor service, Walmart.",

It's under 10 dollars and I just checked the back to see if there was a way to hang it up, and there are 2 screws and that lil hanging thing taped to the back. Now that I think about it I should have checked to see if they had ones w black edging so it would match my bed frame. Or even brown to match my furniture but it's all good. I could hang it in the bathroom I guess. But yep it's a mirror that is 4 '1\" long. It'll work. Thanks",
