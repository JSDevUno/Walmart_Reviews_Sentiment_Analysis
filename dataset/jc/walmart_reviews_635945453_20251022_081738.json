I also was cautious when I read about some models being noisy. I definitely didn't want that. As it is, this one isn't silent - the motor sound isn't loud but it does run at a rather high pitched tone (think a Tesla starting up). I love the deli drawer but miss having a butter keeper.

It's a little bit louder than my last refrigerator but I'm learning to deal with it it's not so loud that you can't concentrate. I was a little disappointed that there is no longer in egg compartment. I do however like that I can slide the deli drawer from side to side. I did notice it's getting harder to find refrigerators with the freezer on the top. I also noticed that the deli drawer is now an extra in a lot of refrigerators. This is the first time I've ever owned a nice maker and it's making more ice than I can use lol",

Better but still had frost/droplets across top of freezer. Second repairman came, called engineering who told him that the air flow is such in this refrig that when you open the refrig door, air pushes into the freezer and causes a small air gap in the freezer seal that cannot be fixed!! Suggested that everytime we open refrig to push freezer shut to avoid this issue. If you want to do this, ok. If not, offered to give me the cost of this refrig on purchase of another.

My guy had to drill the holes in the top as only the metal was predrilled. The bolts that hold the middle plate in are all different sizes. We didn't notice and only moved one, to which the little cover fit but the cover didn't fit the bolt we didn't move (see photo). If you had have built the fridge properly, we could have changed door orientation in about a 1/2 hour, but because you did not build the fridge properly, it took almost two hours to change door orientation, and weren't sure what we were doing. And yes, my guy is experienced in this, and also yes, we tried to follow your inadequate instructions.",

      "title": "The WORST- do NOT purchase Whirlpool Appliances!",
      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased NEW refrigerator in March 2024 for a kitchen renovation. Plugged it up, it seemed to work. Began storing food in fridge and freezer. Food began spoiling quickly and meat did not freeze. Adjusted temperature several times and noticed no positive change. Called Whirlpool, scheduled technician from Jaybee's Appliance Repair for end of May 2024. Technician stated that refrigerator was USED. Due to how screws were placed in sockets in freezer, it suggests someone had tinkered with appliance before. I stated it was supposed to be brand NEW. Technician stated that the fan motor is out as well in this \"brand new\" refrigerator. He takes the part with him stating he's going to order a new one. I left him know I travel for work, so ensure to call me to confirm date and time for installation of new part. Two weeks past, I have not heard from tech. I called the number listed on service order. He answered and stated that there is no ETA on part, but he will call me when it comes in. A week goes by, then another, I called him again. No answer. Called Whirlpool customer service- Deanna calls him, he answers for CS Deanna, and tells agent that he still does not have ETA on part. Agent tells me to call him myself one more time to discuss. I tried and no answer. Another week goes by, I called Jaybee's, no answer, I called Whirlpool CS-Tim, called tech, he answered Tim, and tech told Tim that there is an unknown ETA, etc. STILL NOTHING IS DONE BY WHIRLPOOL OR TECHNICIAN. Another week goes by, I called Jaybee's for update, no answer. I called Whirlpool CS- I got a young woman who's name starts with an R. She stated that the work order was completed. I asked how can it be completed when Jaybee still has my fan motor out of my \"new\" refrigerator? She called him, and he stated that he had ordered the part but cancelled because I was not home and he could not reach me. Jaybee's Appliance Repair LIED. Never did anyone call me regarding an ETA of part or to confirm a time and date to install new part. \"R\" told me that she has to reschedule Jaybee to come back out to my home since he took the part before we can do anything else like schedule a different repair company. She scheduled it for Friday, June 28th. On that Friday, Jaybee called me before normal operating business hours (before 8am). I missed that call as my phone is on sleep mode until 8am. I called back twice, no answer. Jaybee had cancelled my work order and stated in note that he attempted to contact me. Jaybee did not leave a voicemail. And to note all the previous weeks that I called him, I could not leave a vm b/c his vm was not set up. Anyway, I called Whirlpool CS, Vonnie, told me that it would have to be rescheduled again. She told me Jaybee's operating hours are from 6am-2pm, and he'd be rescheduled for Monday, July 1. I received confirmed email of work order outlining that date and 6am-2pm operating work hours. Today is July 1, I have been prepared since 6am to receive a call from Jaybee. I received no call by 1pm, so I called Whirlpool. Apparently, Jaybee cancelled the work order for today and changed it to tomorrow. CS called him, and he stated that he sent me notification of change but wasn't sure if my number was working or if I'd checked my email. My phone is usually right beside me or attached to my hand- I check emails and texts frequently. There were NONE from Jaybee's notifying me of anything. So I wasted a whole day waiting for Jaybee! The CS agent told me that when he made the change it does not generate in the Whirlpool system because he changed it from his company's end. I requested that the CS agent send me a new email for confirmation as proof. She stated she couldn't do that but could send a text message confirming that Jaybee will come tomorrow between 9am-12pm to install new part. Test message was received. We will see if he comes tomorrow and if he truly repairs appliance because I do not trust Jaybee as he does not communicate and lies. Jaybee's Appliance Repair and Whirlpool Appliances are the worst. This is bad business on both their parts. I will NEVER purchase or recommend a Whirlpool appliance or Jaybee's Appliance Repair to anyone. This has been the worst experience going on 3 months now... absolutely ridiculous. P.S.- the doors are not sealed well. One must always look at the doors to ensure they're shut. The appliance overall is JUNK and is manufactured poorly. Just don't purchase a Whirlpool appliance, even if it's free, do not take it!",

The representative assured me that the change would only have a minor effect. However, the freezer still isn't cold enough.

I replaced a 22 year old refrigerator of the same size that still worked and wanted to replace it before it gave out. The new refrigerators configuration of the shelves is much better and while not quiet it's actually less noise than my previous refrigerator. The doors seal good and close easily keeping both freezer and refrigerator cold. I was worried on the first day because it was running constantly but the next morning it was cycling on and off with plenty of off time. The doors are stainless steel and look great but they do finger print easily. I have been opening and closing with the recessed pocket handles to prevent this. This is a good low price and size for 1 person or a second refrigerator but a family would need a larger size. I didn't get the ice maker and have not experienced frosting in the freezer.

There was a problem with the freezer compartment resulting in an excessive buildup of ice. Whirlpool replaced the refrigerator with a new one.The doors on the is one have an excellent seal and I have no further issues. The only thing I dislike about the refrigerator is the light placemen, there is no freezer light and there are several attachments located at the top of the refrigerator compartment that take up a lot of space. These seem to have no purpose.",

It would have been nice to have a freezer light. But the LED lighting in the fridge is great. Good temperature control with the fridge around 34-36 and the freeze at zero or minus 7. My one complaint is the fingerprint resistant feature of this stainless steel model. Seems like this surface spawns fingerprints and smudges. I also don't like the idea of being steered into buying the SS cleaner in the accessory section.",

      "review_text": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It seems like it keeps my food fresher, longer. I also like that it doesn't come with an ice maker, but that the ice maker can be added later. Because it is deeper than my last refrigerator, it holds more food too. What I like best about it is all the storage space in the door. My last fridge had a butter shelf, that took up half the width of the top. Then, it only had 1 other 'shelf' beneath that. This has 3 full 'shelves' in the door, and I like how the top 2 shelves are divided in 2 - length wise. It's very helpful. A few small quibbles. The freezer top shelf doesn't go all the way to the back, so small items can fall to the lower level. Also, when removing the wrap from the front door - the only part of the fridge with stainless steel - it's almost impossible to get it all out of the area on the top of the fridge that it attached to. It scratches fairly easily, too, so it would be nice if a stainless steel wipes packet would be included with the fridge. But, I'm overall very happy. I don't know that I'd get a stainless steel again, but I would definitely buy this model again, maybe in black so it doesn't show dirt. White fridges show dirt. Stainless steel fridges scratch. I think my next fridge, which hopefully won't be for 13 more years, will be black.",
