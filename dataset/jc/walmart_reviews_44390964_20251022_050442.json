I peel this kind of sweet potatoes anyway, there's a layer right under the skin that has no taste. But if you peel them and steam them, they are very tasty. Just a heavier texture to them than some other kinds. So they're very filling, because of the heavier texture. I rated 4 star because they don't seem to keep well past a day or two.

It's just too large for a single serving. In prior orders they were sometimes too small.

I made a sweet potato and black bean casserole, and sweet potato and black bean chili. They were so good that my dad (a refined fellow who brings personal salads to thanksgiving dinner) and my 9 year old daughter (who says she dislikes vegetables) LOVED them. They were good potatoes. They were fresh and chopping them into one inch cubes was satisfyingly loud, the way chopping a fresh potato should be. Starchy and crisp, making me feel like a chef cooking up quality ingredients. These belong on Food Network. Next time I need to scratch that power food itch, I'm adding these to my list. I wanted to add a photo but they were all eaten by the time I saw the review notice so just imagine some really great sweet potatoes and some good food.",

These were the worst sweet potatoes I have ever seen and certainly looked nothing like the photo. I needed 20 decent sized potatoes, I received 19 for a casserole for 50 people. I could only make enough for 20, that's how small they were. I believe the person that picked the order should have called me and given me a heads up and offered a substitution...even canned ones would've been better than what I got. Totally disappointed.",
