It was already being prepared. Therefore, I guess I went to check out I could not change it. What order was being prepared so if that could be credited and changed around it would be nice, but I'm sure it would be an active Congress to get anything accomplished, but if it could be, I'm giving you by permission now to credit everything possible on my last order that was delivered yesterday too, which would've been 17 June credit to my Snap EBT card as I had on there and the balance put on my debit card as normal people do. I'm not trying to be hateful, but I am so tired of number one having to order my food to be delivered, but I have no option. Second time this has been done to me.

These grapes were long and large when grapes are usually small, smaller and round. These were like rounded rectangular and maybe the size of a healthy grape tomato. Most of the grapes were browning at the bottom. This is the condition they came in when they arrived. If I were to look through the store myself, I would not have chosen those.

      "review_text": "Let me start by saying that they were fresh and looked really good. And we all know that grapes are a hit or miss as to whether they're going to be sweet or sour. Well, these were the most sour green grapes that I have ever eaten. And I know that it's not all green grapes. Because the week prior I purchased green grapes from Fred Meyer and they were as sweet as candy. So I'm not bashing Walmarts produce at all. Because along with the green grapes, I purchased the red grapes at the same time. And the red were absolutely sweet and wonderful. And like I said to begin with, when it comes to grapes, you just take your chances cause you never know it has nothing to do with the store that's selling them. So that's why I only gave three stars. That rating is not anything to do with Walmart, it's just my pleasure of the grapes was only worth three stars. Hope this helps.",
