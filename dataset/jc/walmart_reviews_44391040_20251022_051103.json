Two squash (.23 cents!) were wrinkled, limp as a wet rag, %26 had brown spots. So small, not worth using. Maybe the crows will eat them. Am home bound, depend on delivery; can't depend on getting fresh produce. They want to get rid of old stuff fast! DO NOT want refund or exchange BUT PLEASE instruct \"pickers\" on what not to choose. Thank you.",
