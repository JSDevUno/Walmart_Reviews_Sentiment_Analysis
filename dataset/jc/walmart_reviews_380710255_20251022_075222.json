      "review_text": "Omg y'all this ring light makes all the difference it is so awesome! I've always wondered how the people on the youtube videos I watch look so good with nice skin and all...This is their secret! I love this ring light. I found set up to be super easy and didn't really need the instructions. I love that you can plug it into a wall outlet or if you are on the go you can use a usb plug to power it with your phone or power bank or whatever..note the power cord is included the usb cord is not. It comes with its own little storage bag making it compact and easy to store or travel with. The tripod is super easy to adjust and in the picture I included I have two segments of the tripod fully extended and it is taller than me, I'm around 4'10\" so with the third segment fully extended it's even taller than me. There is a holder that you assemble and attach to hold your phone, you can set it to hold you phone sideways or straight up and down depending on how you assemble it and there are slots on the inside and outside of the ring light that you can put it in. I love that you can adjust the light to cool or warm as well as adjust the brightness. This thing is bright enough to light up my living room when I turn the lights out and it's the only thing on. The difference it makes in videos and pictures is amazing I love it. The only thing that could possibly make it better is if there was a button on the remote to make your phone take a picture but I don't use the remote anyway as it's not really needed. The buttons for on and off both turn it on and off also there is a button that says neutral...it does not set the light to neutral light it makes the light pulse off and on..the more you push it the more setting it cycles threw as in pulse, flash, etc. So if you have a light flash sensitivity don't use the neutral button.",

It‚Äôs not cheap like others I‚Äôve tried and you can get the perfect white or warm light with it. Others I‚Äôve tried have a button for low, medium or bright. This you can adjust it to the perfect level. THe phone holder is great as well and doesn‚Äôt feel like cheap plastic that will break easily. I also love that it charges your phone.",

The brightness of the light is good but you cannot change the color of the light say to pink or blue.

The holder of the phone can hold it vertical or horizontal. The base has three feet that go flat on the floor so are very steady and feels secure. The brightness adjusts from low to medium to high. At first I had some trouble getting the remote to work but after putting in the batteries again and trying again it worked. My granddaughter put the light together in about 15 minutes without really looking at instructions. It seemed pretty intuitive to figure out. I can't think if any negatives about it. It has a carry case with handles if you want to break it down and carry it somewhere. It is really very nice and I would highly recommend it.",

I really like that the set includes a pod for to the light and a cradle to put a phone in, everything you need to start using it right out of the box. Assembly was fairly straightforward; however I had some trouble sliding the bottom of the gooseneck mount (for the phone cradle) into a slot. What you will need to do is unscrew it some to get it to fit. It would have been very helpful if the instructions included that detail. There is a remote that comes with this set as well that allows you change the brightness and color temperature of the light. There is also a night mode button on the remote which is a useful feature. A nice carrying bag is also included with the set which a big plus. Overall, this is a great addition to a studio to facilitate producing high-quality photos and videos.",

If you find you‚Äôre not as photogenic as you would like to be while video chatting, you should give one of these a shot. I plan to use this for video chats with friends and family and telehealth appointments from now on. So easy to set up. Another avenue I want to explore is how I can improve the pics and videos of the caterpillars from our butterfly garden. Occasionally we bring some inside to raise while they transform from caterpillars to chrysalis to butterflies. I‚Äôm positive the ring light will be a valuable tool. It‚Äôs lightweight and easy to transport in the soft sided carry case which is provided. The stand is adjustable from 16.9 to 63 inches and pretty sturdy. It‚Äôs made of metal on the bottom with plastic poles. The cord is fairly long and a power supply box is included. The manual is more like a pamphlet and could be more detailed especially concerning the remote control. The remote is touchy and I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to adjust the light settings with it, which vary from warm to cool and in degrees of brightness. However the light unit itself has buttons on the back to control the light settings so you don‚Äôt have to use the remote. There are also four places to mount your phone to the light unit using the bendable phone holder for more angles. I would recommend this set if you are looking for a larger ring light as it is a generous 18 inches and a good value for the price.",

The remote control (requires 2 AAA batteries) functioned well. I suggest a potential buyer open the box in the store to verify that all parts and the instruction manual are there before purchasing.",

When used for video chatting, it adds immediacy and intimacy to the conversation. At first, I thought it was coincidence that my conversations went better, but now I'm convinced that good lighting makes a huge improvement in my ability to communicate. My phone and smaller tablet fit perfectly but laptops and larger tablets will not. DSLR cameras or anything with UNC threading on the bottom will attach just fine. Height and angle adjustment were great and the tripod is quality. It's a little difficult to setup, but thankfully you only have to do that once. It has a light warmth setting but the warmest setting is not as red as I would like. It is also EXTREMELY bright. Even on the low setting it can be fatiguing to the eyes after an extended conversation. I would not recommend to anyone with glasses due to glare.

Not only is this 18\" light ring so much larger than typical 8\" rings, but you have adjustments to brightness and color levels, which can be done manually via controls on the back of the ring or via the included remote. The phone holder is mounted on a fully adjustable snake, so you can tilt the ring, while also adjust the phone side to side and adjust any skewing. Multiple sections to the sturdy tripod enable perfect height. This is good for professionals or also to give amateurs a step up. You can even use the USB slot to charge/plug in your phone or for other accessories.",

The part that holds the phone is easily adjustable as is the stand. You even get a remote that fully controls the power and lighting levels! I think this model has everything anyone could want. It really brightens my face on the screen which is just what I needed. Before I got this, because there is only overhead lighting in my office it was difficult to see my face.

I absolutely love that this comes with an option to plug it in a wall socket. Most ring lights only come with a USB option so the wall outlet was a welcome change. Of course, it has a USB option as well. It comes with a carrying case, making it super easy to carry it anywhere.

The legs are super loose on this one, even tho I tightened them with all the strength in my body. Also the stand doesn't actually lock in place either, the segments slide down at the slightest pressure or adjustment of my phone. Product was put together extremely poorly and very wobbly because of this. I hate this product. However the actual lighting it self is straight. I took this L so you don't have too.

      "review_text": "We were lucky to pick this up when it was on sale and I'm back to buy another at full price! I got this for ‚Äúcreator stuff‚Äù but we quickly adapted it for use as a light in our living room! üòÖ We kinda like the look of it‚Äî vibes with our LR's theme lol‚Äîand it provides a substantial amount of light that I can tune to the natural light. Very bright light! It's positioned so it fires up into the corner of the room. This is not a lighting system that will feel ‚Äúmodern‚Äù, it will feel like the design is from 10-15 years ago. That's expected for a light this powerful at this price point. Keeping the price point out in mind we move to the build quality. I do not have training in the art of tripodlightotry so please forgive the terminology I must use ‚ò∫Ô∏è The tripod uses friction to hold each level of telescopingly-friendly extensions. Each lavel has a flappy-boi on the outside. When that boi is opened, the friction is disengaged and the extensions can slide freebally. To propose to friction, you first keep the extension at the desired height, get down on one knee, and close the flappy-boi. This system has its flaws and for some would be the dealbreaker üò¢ The friction is not great and I had to shimmy some cardboard around the extensions so as to provide some more emotional stability for friction. The system for changing the angle of the head is straightforward and surprisingly durable however it's a little loose. I added a washer and it has been perfect. Don't over-tighten or it could snap. Iirc, the USB port is 2.1a 10w. It didn't know the power output before I bought it so I was surprised. We use it to charge many things throughout the day! The camera connection equipment doesn't include any of those stupid ‚Äúball %26 socket with threaded collar‚Äù features. It's not perfect but it's more secure than those BS systems. The remote control is‚Ä¶OK, it's big than some of the other lights in this price point; it doesn't have a ‚Äúcredit card style‚Äù remote control. It's bulkier and uses I think AAA or AA batteries. It just makes sense to be with this unit. Once you setup the light, secure the flappy-bois, and plug in the heavy AC adaptor‚Äîit's an old school two-piecer‚Äî you'll know exactly what I mean üòä I would recommend this light!",

      "review_text": "It‚Äôs cheap. Not durable at all. I have to say it has great lighting and cool features with the remote. I was satisfied with it until it broke on me, very easily. The tripod pole has 3 settings but the one at the very top holding the ring light is so cheaply made. I had to exchange mine for a different one and as soon as I set it up and tried raising the pole that holds the ring light, it broke again without any effort. The piece that holds it just snapped off and the pole went inside the bigger pole and there is no way of getting it out. This is the second time and it happened to me the same day. I got both receipts as proof. The first one lasted me about 15 days before it just broke by setting the pole at a taller height. The second one seemed to have been broken because I wasn‚Äôt even able to pull up the pole holding the ring light and it broke off without any force. Now I will have to go back to Walmart and to get a refund. I won‚Äôt give it another chance since it‚Äôs just not worth my time or anyones time. My feedback on this item is to make it more solid and durable, even if it‚Äôs cheap materials it shouldn‚Äôt break this easily for its price. I do not recommend this ring light as it is now. I‚Äôm about to go for a refund as I write this review. Save your time and money.",
