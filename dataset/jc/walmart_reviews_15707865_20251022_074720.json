Unfortunately the clock doesn't automatically reset itself if you lay back down but that is on me. The Buzz on the alarm is able to be set at different tones and you can set it to which you find most annoying. It has 4 options when setting the alarm to go off: Buzz, Buzz/Vibrate, Vibrate, and Off. The Vibrate feature itself will wake you up. When i first set up the clock it was sitting in the floor across the room and just the violent buzzing from the vibrate feature woke me up. This morning i woke up to just the Vibrate going off when i stuck it under my mattress. I really just wanted to test this out because of the people that referred me to it... (Including my boss) I've had the clock for about a month now and it hasn't failed to wake me up yet. :)",

The name implies it will be an extremely loud alarm and it just isn't. It is what I'd describe as fairly loud, but not really loud. The whole reason we are buying it is to wake our daughter who sleeps through just about anything. This alarm not being nearly loud as implied, barely wakes her after several minutes and with the vibrator under her pillow. So I'd say it is okay and barely satisfactory, but was hoping for a little more \"boom.\" My second concern is the connectors for the power and vibrator are not crisp. They loosely plug in to the back of the clock and I am worried over time they will begin to fall out easily but only time will tell. I would have much preferred a snug fit for these connectors. If I could give it a 3.5 and a maybe recommend, I probably would, but I like to err on the positive side, so I gave it a 4 and recommend.",

Dials on the side let you change tone/pitch and volume Bed shaker: Excellent! I expected this to be weak and ineffective but this is probably the best feature of the product as it is very strong and is enough to wake even the deepest sleeper without the alarm. Price: This is the turn off for me. I was worried that I would spend more than $30 on a product that didn't work.

This is the first alarm clock I've ever found that I cannot sleep through, no matter what. While I'm disappointed with the bed-shaker to some degree, I'm overall very satisfied. At first, I was very impressed when the bedshaker, upon testing on a tabletop, was doing multiple flips, and seemed very strong. However, when it came to practical application (slid under the mattress, or under my pillow) it was less effective. When I think of a bedshaker, I think of something that actually moves the bed. I've been known to sleep through earthquakes and thunderstorms that threaten to break the windows. A small vibration just isn't enough to make a dent for me. By itself, it would never do what is needed, but in combination with the beep, it is fairly effective as a boost. Being aware that I've been known to smack an alarm clock off while still asleep, I was very glad to see the long cord, both for the main power plug, and for the bedshaker. I was able to place it far enough from my bed that I actually have to get up in order to turn it off, thus reducing the chance I'll fall back asleep after it shuts off. The duration of the beeps is also a plus in this regard. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who has ever had difficulty waking in the morning.",

Highly recommended for anyone hard of hearing or deep heavy sleepers! great for all ages just be mindful of you scare easy bc this thing will make you jolt up and think there's a fire in the house it's so loud!

The high pitch setting sounds like a hotel fire alarm, but you can lower the pitch. The vibrator disc under the mattress is a must to waken teens. If one alarm is not enough ‚Äî you can set the clock for two different times, so my son has a back-up.",

It has 2 different alarms on it. So we set it for my husband first, since he has to be up and gone for work before I need to be up. IT WOKE ME UP. and that was with the vibrating thing on his side. When he got up he switched it to the 2nd alarm and slid the vibrating thing under my pillow. 2 hours later, it went off and I JUMPED UP LIKE I HAD BEEN SHOT. Im a zombie and it worked. I didn't believe it would but it did. Where it's on my husband's side of bed, I had no choice to get up to turn it off or snooze it. After getting startled like that. I had no intentions of snoozing. So yes this works. it's worth the money. Buy it now.",

The family would take turns calling her in the morning and sometimes we would be on the phone 45min to 1 hour trying to wake her up. She was even given a warning at her work for being late. So my daughter showed my the Youtube site on this clock and I was sold. This clock has a vibrate pad that you put under the mattress, flashes lights in your eyes and has an incredibly loud alarm which can be set to different sounds. The only thing it doesn't do is slap you in the face to wake you up. Incredible alarm and would highly recommend it to anyone with problems of waking up in the morning. My daughter hasn't been late one time since she hooked this gismo up. Thankful DAD.",

After that, the pillow vibrator had become useless. My body just quit allowing it to affect me. Then the alarm stopped waking me up. I changed the tone of it in hopes that the reason behind my not waking up was the fact that my body had become custom to the sound. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Another downfall of the clock was the looks. The shape is ridiculous, and the colors are even more so. There is another one with the exact same specifications, with the exceptions of the looks, and it cost $10.00 more. I know I seem really negative in the review, but the clock is the loudest I have heard. 113db may be a stretch, but it is loud. I think the problem lies in my lifestyle, as opposed to the clock. However, I believe this clock was created for people in similar situations, i.e. moms that raise kids and work. Anyway, take this as you will.",

I read a lot of discriptions and reviews before I bought it and I am the exception to the guareented to wake one up. \"I CAN still sleep through the noise\" even though the neighbors might be hearing it. I hear fine when I'm awake. I must sleep really deep. I actually thought it might be louder (that's why not 5 stars). I sleep next to a noisy window air conditioner and with the television on. What does wake me up and get me going is the bedshaker. I slip it into my pillowcase and that seems to do the trick for me. I thought the bedshaker would scare me awake but it isn't that radical or it may be the way I'm positioning it. This alarm is a good buy, well worth the money and the loudest I've ever heard. A little disappointed in the cheesy quality of the plastic (that's also why not 5 stars). It doesn't have a durable feel. That was the first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box besides the aweful plastic smell from the inside packaging. I hope it lasts a long while. Being able to adjust the tone is a great feature for me becuase if I get used to hearing the same noise morning after morning it tends to not disturb me after a while.

This clock did not last one year and was back to the truck stop to purchase another, but was told they no longer carred this brand. The price was comparable to the Sonic Alert. How lucky am I to find this on line at Walmart!! After reading the details on all \"loud alarm clocks\", I chose the Sonic Alert Boom Alarm. I am absolutely thrilled with its performance. Since I am hard of hearing, must have a dependable clock. As yet, have not used the shaker because don't need it.

I could have gotten a stereo system since they can be louder but this is cheaper and figure I would give this a try. It does help with the vibrations under my pillow. Almost sounds like a semi backing up with alert system and you can adjust the sound so it makes a faded or clear alert system. The vibrations are not very comfortable so don't worry about sleeping through the vibrations. You wake up instantly but you can easily fall back asleep from the snooze button. It comes back on so that is good. Haven't timed the snooze button yet. There is a button on the back that you can adjust that sets at (USA)12 hour at 60hz, (UK)12 hour 50hz, (Europe)24 hours at 50 hz. There are 4 adjustment settings on it. Buzz and or vibrate. High or low vibrations. Buzz sounds faded or not so faded. High or low buzz sounds. There is a square battery to put in the back to store the set times which will be great in the storms during summer. I plan on getting another one or two just in case they stop selling this. Don't forget AM or PM settings on it!!! lol",

      "review_text": "I am probably the deepest sleeper you can think of. I once slept through a hurricane, and thunder storms don't phase me. This alarm clock wakes me up EVERY time. Lights flash, the buzzer is loud enough, and the bed shakes. The ONLY drawback to this clock is the fact that the snooze bar only works for an hour. I am chronic about hitting that sucker, and one hour is not uncommon for me to hit it. The snooze deactivates after one hour. The only other improvements I would make from a design aspect would be 2 things. One, make the buzzer more like the sound of an emergency vehicle coming through, because that subconciously affects everybody. Two, I would have the bed shaker a revolving off center motor to be more effective and realistic for a wave effect. However, for the money, this is a VERY good alarm clock (only) and I highly recommend it for heavy sleepers.",

I finally googled \"extra loud alarm clocks\" and quickly found that Sonic Alert was THE brand for deep sleepers. The Sonic Bomb is loud (claims 113db) and also has a disk to go under the mattress or pillow that vibrates very violently. Between the sound and the vibrating disk, he has gotten up on his own ever since we got it. I'm only sorry we didn't discover this product sooner, say when he was in middle school- would have saved many rough mornings in our house. Anyhow, he has it now, and we can send him off to college in the fall without having to worry about whether he'll get up for class or not.",

He puts it in the pillow cover which zips closed then puts a pillow case over that. This way it won't keep falling out. Works well!

Needless to say, morning appt. scare me. This one has the shaker AND the flashing lights. For you deaf and hearing impaired, just make sure to turn off the sonic alarm part!

If he didn't have it turned down he needs to go see an ear doctor. So yes, it is loud, A keeper for me. However, there is a lot of not so good stuff, Like the shape. To set anything you have to pick it up to steady it, but the shape is awkward; slips out of your hand easily. However, it has lots of tricks like two alarms and they are 24 hour type, though not day settable. When the alarm sounds slap it on the top and shuts off for 7 minutes then back on. Even has a bed shaker! So, not so pretty, a bit clumsy to set, but it will wake the dead. Even has a tone adjustment so that while awake you can adjust the tone to the most disturbing for you. The time numbers are huge with adjustable brightness. The clock itself is a night light and its brightness is adjustable too. Any big flaw? Yep, if the electric goes off the time keeps working, but not its display and not the alarm. jimD",

There are also two different alarm setting times. The alarm has an easy off button and you do not need to set the alarm every night. You can also program the duration of the alarm from one minute to 59 minutes, I purchased this alarm for my Mom who needs a hearing aid during daytime hours. Now I do not need to call her every morning and dial back numerous times to waken her.",

While both the battery and the alarm clock were fresh out of their respective boxes, I did test the battery to make sure it was indeed fresh. It was, so I removed the cord from the box and plugged this alarm in to the outlet. It worked fine, but I immediately returned it to my local store because of the issue with the faulty battery connector. I do not know if I will order another one. I will wait and see.",

I gotta say, I am not happy that I spent $30 on a clock that is not any more effective than the regular alarm clock I already had. The buzzer and vibrator woke us up maybe 3 days and that is it. This includes my husband, my 3 yr old and me. I don't know what to say I mean the vibration is pretty strong but I guess we just sleep too hard. The buzzer is supposedly this extremely loud, high decibel alert.....but I do not hear it. So if you are a hard, deep sleeper and you purchase this clock make sure you keep the box for a week or two and try it out first. I made the mistake of throwing mine out and now I am stuck with an overpriced clock that is very unattractive in appearance for my bedroom. Oh well.",
