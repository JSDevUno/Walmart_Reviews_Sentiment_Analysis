Crockpot dinner =Salt sliced unskinned eggplant on wood board, wipe after ten minutes (there's usually enough salt left on for flavor), put in layers; olive oil on bottom, canned tomato puree sauce, oregano, basil, eggplant, bread crumbs, grated cheese, garlic. Repeat until crok is full; final layer is sauce, garlic, spice, little more oil. We ad a bit of nut flour atop each layer of eggplant b4 breadcrumbs = added protein, thickens sauce. Cook in crock over night, add shredded mozzerella on bottom of each serving bowl/plate; heat will melt; over night, overcooks mozz, so wait! Taste and and sprinkle of salt if needed. A healthy eggplant parm; you'll have to wrk out how much spice to your taste. We were told about this and make weekly.",

As soon as it got up to temperature (whatever that means for oil) I tossed in a slice and I got the biggest backsplash ive ever experience. The oil jumped out as my finger and made my skin Bible half an inch off my finger. It was so very painful. So long story short, PLEASE, wear gloves and an apron and use less oil.

I see in the reviews that this has happened to several other people as well. Clearly an issue that needs to be addressed!

      "review_text": "On the Walmart app the eggplant looked so good and fresh. I was making it for dinner but I invited another friend and needed one more in a hurry. I even paid the extra $10 to get it within 75 minutes. I have no complaints on the time but I’m not serving eggplant no more since the one I got is bad. I got a text saying Oscar was shopping and would contact me if there were any changes. My delivery driver said that was the last eggplant and that is why they gave it to me. Shame on Walmart for charging a express delivery fee of $10 on top of the $12.99 and it’s not like they can deliver me another one.",

The eggplant I selected was firm, the topnotch was green, with no exterior imperfections. Two days later I took it out of the fridge to cook and it had started to already get soft and the very green top was getting gray. The worst of this was the SMELL. Discovered that rotten eggplant smells as bad as rotten potatoes. Apparently it was rotting from the inside out and oozing out from under the the top like pus! Point is that in this case, if I'd ordered an eggplant for delivery and this one had been picked, the blame wouldn't be on the picker but the produce supplier. Either way, YUCK!",
