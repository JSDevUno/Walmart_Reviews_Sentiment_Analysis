I like the smaller ones because I can better judge how many to cut open for my use. It seems that with the larger ones I always have a half to much, and then have to refrigerate a half.",

If you're Not sure, buy them individually. I personally take my own time and carefully feeling each one of them there's 4? feel the naval end of the avocado to tell if its ready. I take the ones that are hard that way You can keep an eye on it. And many of times it's ripe ready to eat. I find it affordable and we make sandwiches, chopped and over toss greens, omelettes.

All avocados had sunken spots and non useable. I had to toss. Every time I add a picture it seems it does not get posted. I have decided to stay away from ordering fresh produce. In last few months I have ordered and received non edible strawberries, green beans, tomatoes, lemons, apples, limes and grapes. I really believe the shoppers should be selecting with more care and someone should be removing rotting or spoiled vegies and fruit.

Poor management of produce by walmart and even worse associate selection standards. Do the associates know how to evaluate produce for delivery??? These were definitely way past edible in every respect. I like my Avocadoes firm and a bit green so I can ripen them in a paper bag to my desired perfection. I can gently squeeze an Avocado without bruising it to determine ripeness. These Avocadoes were gently squeezable to the seed. Not a good sign! When I cut them open, brown and black, some liquid came out, and fuzzy mold inside and the smell ... gross. I would take pictures but the Avocadoes are already in the trash bin.",

The one that developed a soft spot was already going bad when cut - small dark cracks in the meat but I still used it. So I can do avocado toast using a whole one, no need to save half of a larger one in the fridge for later. The skins are a bit thinner but the pits are pretty large.

Never a long wait in line, I am notified when my order has been completed, I give notice that I am on my way, I then text them which parking space I am in and the color if my car , the wait is minimal usually only minutes. I have unlocked my trunk and they politely ask where I would like my groceries placed, in my trunk and they always pack them with care. I try to catch them before they hurry to get their next order to deliver to get their names so I can leave feedback so Walmart knows what a joyous time I have picking up my online order at the pickup area. I want them to know how wonderful their employees are and how courteous and polite they are. Your Human Resources have done a marvelous job complying a team that is so very kind and whom I can hardly wait to remind them of this in my feedback always including my delivery persons name to give credit where credit is due. They always lift my spirits each time I pickup my orders. Kudos for making my day better each time I come to get my orders!

Great if you're having a party but I'm only one person. I refrigerated them however, I ended up making a lot of guacamole and shared with friends. Fun but not economic for me!

They arrive \"rock\"-hard, and never ripen correctly. In both instances I placed the eight (8) avocados inside a paper bag, rolled-up the top, and left the bag outside on my front porch (I also put a red apple inside the second bag); it was warm, South Florida weather. By the time the avocados in the first bag were soft enough to cut, the insides were mushy-to-rotten; after four days, the avocados in the second bag remain \"rock\"-hard. This only happens with Haas avocados; it's never happened with other varieties. \"Let the buyer beware!\"",

However, the shipment I received today is an unacceptable affront to any reasonable standard. To call these avocados \"small\" is a gross understatement; they are laughably diminutive, with one specimen barely eclipsing half the size of a golf ball. Extracting even a meager amount of flesh from such pitiful fruit is a futile endeavor. Frankly, the arrival of such substandard goods suggests a severe lapse in Walmart's quality control. It appears your procurement standards have plummeted, allowing suppliers to offload produce that should never reach your shelves. More concerning is the apparent dereliction of duty within the produce department itself. A competent manager or designated staff member would conduct daily inspections, diligently removing overripe or otherwise inferior items. Instead, it seems your home delivery pickers are left to contend with whatever substandard inventory languishes on the shelves. As a former food and produce buyer, I can unequivocally state that the quality control at this particular store is alarmingly close to non-existent. This isn't a minor oversight; it's a systemic failure that disrespects your customers and devalues the trust we place in your brand. This situation demands immediate attention and a commitment to restoring the quality standards that once made your produce section a reliable choice. I refuse to pay for this unacceptable shipment and expect a swift resolution to this deeply concerning issue. Additionally, there were three other produce items I had ordered, and each of them was largely substandard due to half of the fruit items in the bag being so ripe one could literally put the finger directly through it.",
