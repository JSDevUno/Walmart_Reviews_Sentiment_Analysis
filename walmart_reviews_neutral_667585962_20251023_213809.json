It was delivered to the local area, returned to the area it had come from and reshipped to me. The order took about 2 1/2 weeks. When it arrived it had been repackaged, the middle logs were wet like they had been peed on. The order was a waste and was pitched. I am very disillusioned about Walmart's shipping.",

However, the burn is clean and great for the first hour and a half, then the flames start going smaller and smaller. They have cut the quality or made a negative change because they use to do the three hours as advertised and as they use to. I am pretty much forced to use these as I have not found any other that I like better. We use these in a fireplace. I'm sitting here looking at one barely burning that I put in one hour and fifty five minutes ago and the flame is barely coming out. Now, if I poke it and break it up into small pieces, it will burn big for a few minutes and then dwindle down to nothing rather quickly. They are great to start a new wood fire quickly, like the one person said, \"put the log under the wood and then light it\". To me they are better than the fire starters to get a fire started quickly. - burn good - no odors - great for starting the wood fire Do not last three hours",
