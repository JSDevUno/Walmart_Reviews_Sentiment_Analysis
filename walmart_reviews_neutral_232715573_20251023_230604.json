      "review_text": "This 4-shelf storage cabinet with doors would be a great place to store items out of sight and organized, whether you use it in the garage, study, craft room or game room. However, it is plastic and not very sturdy. The shelves can hold only 30 pounds so the items that can be stored in this cabinet are limited. I’m not sure I’d trust a shelf to hold a 6-pack of soda. When you open the box, be surprised to find cracked or broken pieces, missing or duplicate pieces. If you receive all the pieces in good condition, be extremely careful during assembly. This storage cabinet is fairly easy to put together. No tools are required but a rubber mallet may come in handy. Read the assembly instructions, lay out all the parts, take your time and try not to get frustrated. It took me and my daughter longer than it would for most people, even though both of us have years of experience assembling boxed furniture. I cannot, in good faith, recommend this storage cabinet. A metal/steel cabinet, with or without doors, would be a much better investment even though the cost is more.",

Especially because the doors do not close all of the way (including on the sides), water will be able to get in if it is rained on. This is also expensive for what it is. A better price would have been about $80. If you'll have this in the house and don't need the doors to completely close, buy it. If you need it to be outside, buy something else.",

      "review_text": "The product itself is good except for what I am guessing is a piece that is supposed to represent a middle hinge on the doors. Didn't work, both sides broke off the first time I opened the doors. No matter...doors function fine without them. Big plus, this whole assembly requires NO hardware. On the negative side the instructions leave a lot to be desired especially as far the pictures go. Black on black so doesn't work. It also doesn't work far as the parts being labeled. Took the light hitting just right that I finally even noticed they were labeled. I was about halfway through assembly before I saw them...duh. It did go together well even with the broken middle \"hinges?\" Works well, Shelves are sturdy so all in all I am good with the unit. My biggest bone to pick is Walmart delivery. When I first saw this product in the store there were 3 units sitting on the shelf. I went home and price checked the unit in other places and not only did Walmart have the best price my CC provided a link that allowed me to get 5% cash back.....BONUS. Yeah, so I ordered through the link for pickup the next day. I soon get a noticed telling me not available for pickup and they would ship it to me. Now I'm thinking WOW they sold the 3 units I saw sitting on the shelf that morning. I get the unit a couple days latter via, FEDEX. Assemble it, get it into use...happy camper. UNTIL I am shopping at Walmart a day or so later and low and behold.....all 3 units are still sitting on the shelf. Gotta wonder whether it was a management issue, some weird policy issue or lazy employee issue but someone really needs to address that. 5% cash back to me and God only knows what they paid FedEx to ship it to me. On a $120 purchase the profit margin must be out the roof for them to make any money on that deal. Rant over.",

If you bump the shelves with nothing on them they move. It also seems like it would be very easy to knock over.

Assembled it is 18.5 inches long, 25.47 inches wide and 69.38 inches tall. It can be used in bedrooms, bathrooms, patios, garages, and more. It has 4 shelves that are moveable. When I put it together the main part of cupboard was super easy and understandable. Once it came to putt in the shelves it got very confusing. They didn’t fit, took multiple tried to get one shelf to stay in and would require me to push the left “wall” in to get it to snap together. Overall it will work well for holding light simple items but the shelves do collapse sometimes. It is poor quality and flimsy for what it is.",

Nice not to have to use any screws , nuts or bolts, all the pieces just snapped into place. I did have to get out my rubber mallot as some pieces I had ti disassemble as there was an order to put the pieces together. 20 pieces altogether.

Had an issue with one of the shelves getting it to lock in. But the cabinet took less than 30 minutes to snap together the instructions were easy to read and understand. The doors open and close fine and you can add a lock. Just wish the plastic was a little more stronger.",

      "review_text": "This is a cheap plastic cabinet. I am not sure it is worth the money to spend, but I do know how expensive other cabinets can be. This one does serve its purpose in a decent way. You do get what you pay for I guess. The instructions are lacking details in places but you can generally figure it out. There was one step missing, where it showed the picture but didn't say anything about installing the part. I did received mine with a hole in the box and 2 pieces were damaged. They were still usable and it isn't worth the hassle to replace them. The shelves are kind of difficult to \"lock down\" because the plastic is so bendable/warped. There is a QR code that says is a link for video instructions, but it only takes you to the Wal-Mart site for the item. I saw nowhere on that page a link for the instruction video. It is unfortunate you can only upload 2 pictures. I have many to show, good and bad.",

      "review_text": "I'm usually pretty good with following directions but failed to first pull it up in YouTube. I ended up cracking a piece that fits in the top/bottom of the doors, so my unit is doorless. Not a big deal, it's inside a nook in a closet for luggage, purses, etc., not used often. Quality- a bit flimsy for the price, I would pay half at most if I had to buy again. High probability neither will happen.",

The bottom floor shelf area has plenty of room to store an oversized sewing machine. Parts pop into place and hold solid tight. Don't think in terms of \"just\" for the garage storage. Missing the crucial \"roof\" of the cabinet, and have notified them for \"part missing.\"",
