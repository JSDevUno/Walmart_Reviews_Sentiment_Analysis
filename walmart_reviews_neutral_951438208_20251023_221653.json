      "review_text": "I liked everything about this TV stand except the color. We chose expressing but when it arrived it was so dark it looked almost black. On the picture expresso looked like a dark brown which would have matched My Moms living room furniture so I was a little disappointed how dark it ended up being. I think the colors were slightly off with the names/pictures of each color so ordering the lighter color may have been just what we needed.",

      "review_text": "It's nice but when it was finished being put together the top part was not secure so when moved it CANNOT be carried by the top part but the Bottom Only. Also one side of the top doesn't fit perfectly to the rest of the stand there is a 1mm space in between in which is not present on the other side. There are alot of steps to putting it together but it can be done. Other than these 2 issues it is nice looking tv stand and sits a 50 inch on it well.",

      "review_text": "Overall I am not completely disappointed as the stand does serve the purpose of being a place to stand our television on. The quality is ok very delicate though. I did not like the legs on the bottom. Should be a easier way to put them on. Or it would be best if assembly for the legs would not be required. The legs are not even so the stand wobbles. It isn't too big which does make it a great size for our small cozy living room.",
