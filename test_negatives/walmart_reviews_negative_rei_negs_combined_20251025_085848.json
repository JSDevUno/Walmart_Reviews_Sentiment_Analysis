I replied it was not delivered and I would like a refund. Waited a few more days, no response. I contacted Walmart again, again they reached out to the seller to contact me. The second email from buyer basically said it was delivered check with neighbors or family members to check receipt. I replied back that I have cameras, my neighbors have cameras and nothing was delivered. I also advised them that delivery services take pictures of the package when it's delivered. I got the email it was delivered but no picture. Walmart was very helpful in every aspect of this. I only gave a low rating so they would take notice of their 3rd party seller on marketplace.

While the larger amount of RAM, the better processor, and faster USB ports were an immediate benefit, I was disappointed that HP has removed the rear line-input and didn't fit an optical drive. I was aware of the missing input, and I've had to utilise the front socket. However, I was misled about the optical drive. I had asked the sales support if an optical drive was fitted, and I understood it was. It isn't. It may well be possible to fit one later, but that's not the point. Also, I've mixed feelings about HP Wolf Security. Having read a lot of reviews I'm in two minds whether to replace with my trusted alternative. However, having said all that, I'm looking forward to years of reliable service. If the G9 does as well as the G4 I'll be well pleased.",

I wouldn't of even cared, but windows 10 wont be supported on this computer in the next few months. Just for the fact that's they were so deceiving about all of it, makes me so frustrated for other customers of theirs that won't notice. If they fixed the mistake or at least acknowledged it happened, that would be one thing. But straight up taking advantage of people is unacceptable.",

Also, the shift key on the right side is much smaller than the standard keyboard. The caps lock key doesn't have a light on it, so there is no way for me to know that I've accidentally hit it until I notice all letters are in capitols. In addition to the keyboard design flaws, the mouse pad is rather large, which makes it awkward for me to use because I usually rest my wrist on the bottom of laptop as I type, which makes my hand heel hit the mouse pad. If you are a poor typist (one of people who use only two fingers to type) and do not bend your wrist or rest your wrist as you type, this laptop might work well for you.",

Two days after receiving laptop began sending me messages for updates needed and out of date. (verion of windows has reached end of service actual message). However upon trying to update from windows version 22H2 to 23H2 it will not allow me because the end of service date was Oct 8 2024. Contacted microsoft about this issue and how to update and thier response was i am unable too. According to them the processer is not big enough and out of date so untill this issue resolved i am stuck. I informed them that this was a new laptop and purchased within days of contacting them. Thier response was i had been misinformed because in fact after they tried to use their team view to investigate the problem i was told the laptop was actually 4 years old according to their checkout of the laptop. My question to you is how would you like to proceed in making good on this purchase? I purchased this laptop for my buisness and have aleady lost two weeks dealing with these issues so sending this one back for repairs is unacceptable in my opinion due to the fact it was advertised as being new. I propose that you in fact send me a verifiable new unit with an RGA number and address to send this unit back to you postage paid. I will be anticipating your response and contacting me as soon as possible",

Mouse for it my daughter going to have to spend another $70 for a mouse we hope will work. I sent the seller 2 messages and no reply.

I'm giving it 4 stars becaue it does make a good laptop for general stuff like studying and playing normal minecraft.

They told me it would take several months for them to “repair” it and even then, it is “unknown”. I told them I cannot be months without a laptop, and they told me there's essentially nothing they can do. They then turned around and offered a replacement. I asked them if I would have to cover shipping costs to send the faulty product back, and explained that I cannot afford to send a laptop to New York (do y'all know how much that would cost? I can't do it, I'm struggling to get by right now). They got rude with me, saying that they won't cover the costs because I'm past my one year after sales period, even though I'm not? Then proceeded to tell me I agreed to a partial refund when I was never offered a refund nor did I agree to one, because I wasn't offered one? Even if I had been, I'm not agreeing to a partial refund for something I paid $310 for and haven't even had a year only for it be messing up already.",

          "review_text": "I am a bit surprised that Walmart would allow a fraudulent Marketplace Supplier to run a scam on your portal. The subject order was placed with Walmart. Payment for subject order was made to Walmart. Subject order was returned utilizing the UPS Return Authorization Shipping Label paid for and provided by your Marketplace Supplier. Proof of Delivery of the return of subject order was provided to both Walmart and your Marketplace Supplier. All my attempts to follow-up with your Marketplace Supplier regarding a refund have been either ignored or summarily dismissed. Subsequent contacts with the Walmart Customer Service Department seemed to be spiraling into the black hole of your circular files. All requested responses to E-Mails from Walmart Customer Service, Customer Care and Payments sent to me go to their unmonitored address. Seems like there should be a better way to communicate!! I'm beginning to think Walmart could care less if this issue is ever resolved. Your assistance in resolving this lingering issue and providing the refund credit due would be much appreciated.",

So Apple won't cover repair bc seller won't update DOS to the true date. Walmart and myself have tried contacting this seller multiple times and all they do is send back and copy and pasted response telling me how to print from my account. I don't need to print, I need Walmart to be honest and update the sale date to what it truly is. Unfortunately, no one can seem to figure this out. I have called customer service at least 15 times and spent about four hours on the phone. I have called my local Walmart stores in a desperate attempt for help, but they have no offerings, and the third-party seller has been contacted. Still no solution. So here I am with AirPods that won't charge, a manufactures warranty that won't be honored, and an extended warranty plan through Allstate, which won't be honored, because they say that I was supposed to be covered by Apple. Everyone in the situation is just putting your hands up in the air like “it wasn't me, it wasn't me” but I am not looking to blame anyone, I am desperately searching for a solution.",

Unfortunately, mine has a pop stand and my phone does not charge. I did have to remove it from the case and t would charge then, but at a slower rate than if I plugged up my phone. Considering this wireless charger has a C cord connection and has to have a block to plug into an outlet to charge, I see no point in having it when you can use a wall charger.",

I have tried it with my husbands Apple Watch with the same results. Now the scary part. The charging block that came with the dock makes many weird noises, it makes some weird beeping noises that I can't really explain. I'm afraid that it might be a safety hazard and don't want the block to cause a fire. I have discontinued use but cannot return. It's very unfortunate.",

          "review_text": "I bought 4 of these fans last year (April 2024). All 4 have broken in the same exact spot (the clip that holds them onto whatever you put them on). In my case, I've had all 4 fans on a seedling grow shelf and have never once moved them. 2 of the clips snapped within the first year. And, oddly enough, the other 2 clips snapped within 24 hours of each other (July 17 and 18 of 2025). Definitely not build for long term use.",

I just finally realized that my plants weren't moving and then I felt them and there was no air coming out of them. And then they have just fallen off my shelves. The clips just snap and fall off.

The Honeywell wasn't available, and it being hurricane season, decided to give this one a try. What a mistake. Firstly, when I received the fan it was clear that it had been used and the previous owner had been kind enough to stick the cables severed usb port to a sticky label, so it wouldn't get lost. I decided to try it with batteries which only lasted a few hours, compared to my Honeywells that run for multiple days. Unlike the Honeywell it has multiple speeds. The profile is bigger than the Honeywell, but only has a third of the power. It died after 2 weeks of occasional use and 16 batteries. I'm usually happy with Mainstay products, but this one needs to be pulled from shelves.",

The other has a \"T\" shaped angle adjustment knob and the bottom of the base is made to sit flat. This type makes a normal humming noise running. I tried returning the whistling one hoping to get another of the type that is better and just hums when running. Unfortunately, I got another whistling type as a replacement.",

I think its because that files size are very small almost all smaller than 5 MB. attached image shows 60 pieces of recordings in one folder in a night it should be one piece. and its worth to mention there are some JPG files inside it, it also can't be opened. the MMC card is also New and I was using it in my mobile till i put it in camera. please let me know how to fix it ? also is there any way that I should check the recording from mobile? as I can only see live video on mobile now.",

In other words, you might as well get an extension cord to go with. I didn't like the set up it took to long. And you basically have to set the camera on the WIFI box to hook it up. One more thing and it's a pet peeve of mine. Manufacturers of products that take SD cards should provide a starter card with their product.

It should be a simple toggle after typing in the password, and then possible ask for the password again or some second measure per computer. The software needs to be updated.

When I checked the drive, it didn't show errors so I checked the cords with alternatives I knew to be working well. The noise was not consistent so I attempted to load files. The files wouldn't show correctly as if they weren't loading onto the drive. When I closed the folder and reopened, they were there. This is also not normal behavior. I also noticed intermittent behaviors were the drive would load much slower than the rest (including another 12 tb with matching files). Sometimes taking 15-20 minutes (I'd give up on it loading and go do something else only to come back and it's loaded). It has caused disk utility to crash and I haven't had that happen before. DU only crashes or loads very slowly when this drive is connected. Sometimes the drive doesn't connect at all. I reached out for support but will likely have to exchange under warranty. I feel there is something not right and I have numerous WD EHD's, this one is not behaving normally. I have a concern of being forced into a refurbished option but my drive is only 2.5 months old and has had this problem since day one. I wish I'd gone with my gut for the exchange before the first 30 days. I am also concerned I will now have additional shipping costs despite that this drive was sent to me like this.",

My WDBFJK004OHBK My WD My Book hard drive is not working correctly, I was in the middle of downloading some files and shut my computer down to run errands and when I came back to finish the files my My Book was no longer showing up in my file explorer, it does show up under the section where it says eject item, it shows up in the drives manager but not the other manager. The hard drive is running, and light shows from the inside.( I ran the WD digital Data Life guard Diagnostics Tool and it shows the my book but says not available)As I said it was working perfectly and my errands took less than 30 minutes when it stopped showing in the file explorer anymore. The more I look into wd hard drives the more I find that thier products have a lot of issues that I did not know about when I looked into the research originally. I tried everything that was suggested. I plugged the hardrive directly into the wall, I shut down the computer a couple of times, I went in and unistalled the my book drive under all the areas you could do that and reinstalled nothing worked!!! this is ridulous how can their products have so many issues this one does not make sense. it was working and than it wasnt and I can not get to my files that I was back up which is the whole point of these products how is wd sitll in business seriously!? Issue 2 I plugged in my passport 2tb external hard drive that was working perfectly and has thousands of vids and other files on it into my WD live Media player to watch something off it and it played for a second (3 issues) but the purple screen that often happens with the WD media showed up again the files played fine but when I was done unplugging the hdmi cable it would not show the files on the screen anymore and now when I plug the passport in my computer to check it it will not show up on my File explorer or the drive file at all now!! This is Crap WD all of this has happened in just the past 3 days in the middle of another Covid shutdown, again how is this company still in business I now have several thousand files, and movies and things that I can now now find or retrieve or whatever!!!?? and these were my backups I only have some of what was on my My Book hardrive that is back uped on another hardrive but some of the best stuff was on this passport that suddenly stopped working or something??!Q!",

Mind you, it was 32 degrees outside. I stood there for 15 minutes waiting for one of the employees to stop leaning and sitting (in clear view) to come to the door and engage me. If I return, I won't use the unprofessional pickup service. This was a horrible customer service experience. If I could leave zero stars, I would. Training is definitely needed!

Mind you, it was 32 degrees outside. I stood there for 15 minutes waiting for one of the employees to stop leaning and sitting (in clear view) to come to the door and engage me. If I return, I won't use the unprofessional pickup service. This was a horrible customer service experience. If I could leave zero stars, I would. Training is definitely needed!

I didn't even bother plugging it in at this point, because what's the point?! I purchased the extra 4 year warranty, and much to my surprise, it states there's a 19 day waiting period before I can even use it and then it states that my warranty doesn't even begin until July 02, 2025!

          "review_text": "there was a washer sticking out of the top of the display case. the top 1\" of the display flickered. the machine was not properly cleaned of the old software, so win11 tried to load, it kept failing. 89$ for tech support that claimed installation was a complete lie. Since win11 could not load,it could not connect to the internet. and tech support says if they can't get to the machine to load the remote control app, then they have no responsibility to refund me any money. The customer service desk had me sitting on the floor for 20 minutes until they could figure out how to do a return. they woman at the desk was completely untrained. and the MGR. was impolite and disrespectful. His attitude was that i was an idiot. He claimed the packaging was not walmarts...no it wasn't. It was from walmarts reuilder vendor which i had to show him using packing label on the box, duh. I paid 425$~ and got promised a refund of 353.00~ when the vendor determines I can have one...This is the worst experience i have ever had with Walmart. I will sue you for the return. not kidding. money's not important my pound of flesh is. you took 2 days of my time and was lied to, both in person and over the phone. your add was a lie, concerning tech support. what a rip-off.",

Limited help on the app you have to download to set it up. Screens flash for about a second, can't see what you want to on that amount of time. Nothing that tells what the knobs and buttons do. Watch went beserk the other day after my walk , all I wanted was to check to see if the watch and phone came up with the same amount of steps, wouldn't shut off, I finally turned off the blue tooth! Weather/temp only works when it wants to, even then it's way below the phone readings, which makes me wonder if anything is accurate on this Watch. Should return it, maybe I got a bad one, and never should have got the extended warranty!!",

We put screen protectors on them because they looked like they might scratch. Despite that when one girl dropped hers on a laminate floor and the screen shattered. Another bumped the side of a chair with hers and it also shattered. A drop of less that three feet breaking it surprised me, and I think that they should be able to survive accidentally running into a chair. They don't seem capable surviving of real life.

Unbalanced and very slightly muffled. Other features tend to fall to preference wuch as wired vs wireless or mesh vs leatherette ear cups.

          "review_text": "I would've rated this 5 stars but I have a few concerns/issues regarding this headset and I'm hoping the manufacturer/merchant sees this review and offers help. My first concern is that there were no written instructions or any kind of paperwork/manual in the box; it just contained the headset with the headband, USB receiver and the charging cord, no user documentation as it states on the box. My second concern is that when I am using the headset for work (windows 11 PC) it works great for the most part but my mic is muted even though it is flipped down. Now this is an intermittent issue but a critical issue as I am an inbound call center rep and the issue has occurred at the beginning of receiving a call. I use it with the avaya software as well as Microsoft teams, my mic gets muted when flipped down regardless of the software I'm using at the time. The only “fix” I have found is to flip the mic back up, wait a second and then flip it back down and it'll then unmute. Other than these 2 concerns, the headset is super comfortable - I wear glasses and rarely feel discomfort, it has great audio quality and noise cancellation for both the mic and earpieces. I really like this headset, I can see myself using it for a long time; I just need to find a way to fix the mic muting issue!",

Ain't no way in heck a 20,000 battery should have gone through 25% of its charge for 5% phone battery. Have 8000mah batteries that gave almost two full charges before being empty. Second, it does not support fast charging or type c to type c charging. Must rely on slower, outdated USB ports. 3rd, both batteries make this God awful whining sound when charging.

Not to mention when charging the battery or charging with the battery, it gets unnervingly warm whereas the other 2 I own from different brands don't get warm at all.. For the price it's cheap enough to where I'm not worried about a return or a refund but I wouldn't recommend it, just spend a little bit more and get a battery that is much better quality.

          "review_text": "This monitor appears nice on the outside, as it is asthetically pleasing, however, once you get on the inside, nothing but disappointment lurks. This is one of those times where the old saying \"you get what you pay for\" comes into play. There is one, and only one, button on this whole screen and it is a toggle like a joystick that you would find on a game controller. Using this toggle is clunky and awkward, especially with your arm around the screen. Toggling through available selections and selecting something to change is a nightmare all in it's own. This wouldn't be such a big deal if I was only using one input but I often switch between the two and the functionality just ins't there. It's stupid, to say the least. My favorite part is that sometimes when switching between inputs, nothing happens, and you have to unplug the cable you're not trying to use. Lucikly my desk is set up in a way that I can get to the back of it easily, but I shouldn't have to. Aside from input control, the on screen text leaves something to be disired - the font looks...pixelated? I don't know how to explain it other than to say it is NOT clear. If it wasn't for the size of the screen, I would have trouble reading. I have not used this monitor for gaming, so I can't speak to that, but I have used it for streaming which is just o.k. The blacks aren't very deep and the colors are so so. I am using this as a second monitor to a Dell laptop and the Dell is crystal clear for comparison. Overall, this just wasn't a good purchase, and you can order the same monitor from Temu, if that tells you anything.",

Their budget phones under 100 bucks are getting worse every year. Unfortunately this Samsung has not exactly blew me away. Its slow. When I'm out of the house I use ATT service. Its always been a bit slow but...this phone is taking over 2 minutes to open an app. At home using the wifi it even drags.Trying to type this review the phone cut off twice. I can't believe that people like this piece of sh%23t. Its too bad because Samsung makes good budget phones. Or they used to.Now they make 5000 dollar televisions. Dont buy this phone if you enjoy communicating.It sucks.",

They kept telling me to go to the store, However that's the reason for DELIVERY in the first place. I can't get to the store. They never have anything on track . I'm a faithful longtime Walmart customer and Walmart has done nothing but fail me over and over. After this, I'm sure I'll be taking my business elsewhere!!",

It's still a decent phone for the price and it has nice big buttons and a bright screen. It also has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot feature (you need to have the service enabled on your plan).

I can only assume that the company sent me a refurbished phone, even though it is not mentioned anywhere in the ad. And by the way. That customer service representative who handled my complaint was stellar and great! Also, I can't do a return, cause the phone will not charge. As in, it will not hold a charge. it lights up zero. So I cannot return it back to factory settings. My info is still on the phone. I know now that my seven years of bad luck begins with this company(Motorola). Money down the toilet.

Also I've had an issue w an ironic case of while a missed call was leaving me a voicemail, I just so happened received another call that I wasn't even notified of & it didn't even show up in my missed call log . Luckily they left a message & it was recorded there & also in my visual voicemail as it was an important call as it was a from Dr office of whom my Dr referred me to to make an appointment to a cardiologist, so that was a terrible glitch for me personally so why I took a way another star.",

Their customer service was terrible as with most companies their customer service is based out of another country which is fine however, she couldn't even reach them at all. Every time she tried to call I would have to call from my phone she could not use 611 nor could she call their 800 number I do not recommend straight talk at all nor do I recommend this phone.
