While on the drive, I noticed the smell of propane in my car. This heater was leaking propane. I immediately disassembled it and continued on. At the campsite, I attached two different bottles of new propane bottles, and you could hear the hiss of a leak. No matter how I careful to make sure it was screwed on and tightened. Ended up not using it in fear of a gas buildup causing suffocation or fire. Returning as soon as I get back home.",
