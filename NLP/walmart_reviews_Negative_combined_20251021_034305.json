This only ever used to happen when the tablet dissolved completely. Now it's happening before it's dissolved, AND it is creating cloudy water in the tank and bubbles as it flushes. I noticed that a couple weeks ago and was confused but at the time didn't connect the two. The formula HAS TO GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA. THESE ARE ABSOLUTE TRASH!

          "review_text": "Walmart has changed the ingrediends in these tabs! Compared to the former box and this new box it is a MAJOR difference! Firs they made them bigger which is nonsense as one does not want the tabs to interfere with the toilet flush flapper. I put one each tank on May 23/24 They did not work. What is going on?! Today 6/1/24 looked in the tank. There was this murkey haze especially over and around the tab. Using the toilet brush to touch it, it was a mass of disguting slimy goo!! What a mess to get out the tanks! My husband got the mass of gooey stuff out of them had to use an old kitty litter scoop, then keep flushing the tank out with a hose! I did get my money back but will NEVER EVER get these again!! Do use! They make a terrible gooey mess and absolutely do NOT work in anyway!!!",

I used them at home and at my business. They worked great at both places, especially at my private nail studio. I have hard water there and tend to have a constant reoccurring water ring. If I'm off for the weekend and the toilet isn't flushed for a day or 2, the ring returns. Since using these tablets, I have not seen the ring! Each tablet is very long lasting. They are conveniently sold at Walmart stores everywhere. As long as these tablets are available, I will continue using them! I would love to try them in different scents too! Maybe lavender? Lime?

          "review_text": "Have been using this product for years and years. More than a decade. As many others have written, Walmart recently changed this product, but the packaging is the same. Used to be a pressed cake of a powder type product. Lasted 2-3 months and did a great job. It would slowly dissolve and shrink to a smaller and smaller puck. In the past few months, it is now a different chemical makeup, slightly different shape and is more a crystalline puck which turns into a blobby mound. And does not last nearly as long, which means your bowl starts to get dirty much faster. I can't imagine why anyone would continue to use this product, having experienced the effectiveness of the prior. With all these one star ratings, you'd think Walmart would want to fix this mistake but who knows. We're changing to Clorox, which I believe is a slightly smaller puck, at a higher price unfortunately...but at least it works! Also, don't know if it's a coincidence but some of the rubber and plastic parts in the the flapper/valve assembly have disintegrated substantially. Even the tube which provides the water fill has become gummy, semi-melted, and it doesn't even sit in the water! I have a feeling there's some nasty chemical(s) in this new formulation which are particularly corrosive to rubber and or vinyl plastics. So not only less effective but potentially destroying the parts inside the tank, including the gaskets! Get ready for a leak!",

I was fortunate enough to receive the four tablet box but the way they were packaged brought the star rating down. After all, I was afraid that if cut incorrectly to separate the two tablet packs, I'd accidentally open both. Once open though, it was very easy to use. After all, you simply took the lid off the toilet tank and dropped it into the corner. You do have to wait about 20 minutes before you can flush it but it's worth the wait. I've noticed my toilet to be much shinier and less noticeably smelly. It seems to be doing a good job preventing staining and sticking and hasn't caused any issue while flushing. It does look interesting in the tank but because it seems to be working, I'll keep an eye on when to replace it. It doesn't seem to disappear quickly and that's appreciated. Overall, I'm glad I was able to try this and do appreciate how much easier it's made cleaning the toilet. Definitely a worthwhile cleaning item! Thank you!!",

There is no strong scent of bleach, which I'm honestly thankful for because a strong bleach scent can give me a headache. So far, I feel these are working in keeping my toilet bowl clean between deep cleanings. I do see a lot of bubbles in the toilet water after each flush, as I would with other toilet bowl cleaner tablets. As for the tablet itself, it seems to be dissolving at a good rate, which I hope means it will last at least a month or two.

I have to agree with other folks that this product has been reformulated or changed and is no longer effective. Normally, when you drop a fresh tablet into a tank, you get an initial stiff dose of chlorine smell from it, before it settles down to a steady, low dose. Not this time. And it has had no effect in keeping bacterial growth in check. A 'normal' tablet remains solid and gradually shrinks in size as the material slowly dissolves. This batch quickly dissolves into a semi-crystalline blob of mush. I found this out when I lifted the tank lid to see why the fill was running on. The flapper had warped and wouldn't seal. Admittedly, the flapper was very old, an easy fix and everyone says this can happen with cleaner tablets, but the timing struck me as odd. Bottom line: 'Bleaching Action' is not the same as actual chlorine bleach in these products. This formulation relies on borax and I will avoid such in the future, as it absolutely doesn't work for me.",

They are most definitely NOT the same product I've always received. Skip to today when I realized the toilets in the house were already starting to have a film and form rings. This only ever used to happen when the tablet dissolved completely. Now it's happening before it's dissolved, AND it is creating cloudy water in the tank and bubbles as it flushes. I noticed that a couple weeks ago and was confused but at the time didn't connect the two. The formula HAS TO GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA. THESE ARE ABSOLUTE TRASH!

Which makes it perfect to add cushions and they fit nicely for larger bodies. The wood is a bit soft and I'm praying that doesn't affect them holding up for the long term. I enjoy the fact that they came with the adjustable feet that protect against scratches on my wooden floors pre-installed. Easy to put together with bolts already installed which made lining up screws and them catching a breeze. Great product overall. I may need to order another set to finish off seating for 6.",

After only one month of normal use, a part for one of the chairs completely broke while an adult was sitting on it. The person was well below the product's stated weight limit, so this is a clear manufacturing defect. To make matters worse, the manufacturer's customer service was just as bad as the product's quality. When I contacted them for a warranty replacement part (just the part not the whole chair), they refused to send it unless I paid a $25 shipping fee. A company should not charge customers to fix their brand new, defective products. Between the dangerous lack of quality and the unhelpful manufacturer support, I cannot recommend these chairs at all.

Which makes it perfect to add cushions and they fit nicely for larger bodies. The wood is a bit soft and I'm praying that doesn't affect them holding up for the long term. I enjoy the fact that they came with the adjustable feet that protect against scratches on my wooden floors pre-installed. Easy to put together with bolts already installed which made lining up screws and them catching a breeze. Great product overall. I may need to order another set to finish off seating for 6.",

After only one month of normal use, a part for one of the chairs completely broke while an adult was sitting on it. The person was well below the product's stated weight limit, so this is a clear manufacturing defect. To make matters worse, the manufacturer's customer service was just as bad as the product's quality. When I contacted them for a warranty replacement part (just the part not the whole chair), they refused to send it unless I paid a $25 shipping fee.

          "review_text": "The online website failed to update the ingredients list with new allergens not previously contained in this 64oz size OJ. This produce NOW contains traces of MILK, EGGS and SOY and I had a bad reaction! A few months ago, it was only the gallon sized OJ that had those allergens, but now it is ALSO the 64oz size!! I am so disappointed. I have a severe allergy to inhaled particles of soy and eggs--and a few minutes after I poured a glass of orange juice for my son, my throat began to get tight! I had to take an antihistamine quickly and open the window, and my husband had to take my son outside so he could drink the juice! So ridiculous. The price is a few pennies cheaper than other brands, and we are a lower-income family--so we picked this product and ordered it online. Sadly the ingredients label wasn't updated in the photos. I tookj a photo showing the new label contains these three serious allergens. I tried uploading it as a JPG 194 KB (well under the 5 MB max) and it failed, and then tried uploading as a PNG image (1.14 MB -- still well under the 5 MB max) and that failed as well. The website says there is a problem even though my pic is well under maximum of 5MB. I have tried uploading and re-creating this post in both my Chrome browser and in Microsof Edge Browser, but no option works for a successful upload, so that isn't fair either. But believe me there are REAL traces of these allergens in the product now, if anyone in your family is allergic to these allergens, then DON'T buy this product.",

When he sampled it, it was clearly distasteful, as if it had fermented and soured. This was despite opening it on the \"Best By\" date. We threw it out. Last week, I decided to give this product another try. The \"Best By\"date for the container I purchased is Sept. 16. (There is no year printed on the bottle, but I assumed it was for 2023.) When I opened the bottle, it made a slight fizzing sound, but the juice seemed fine. But over the next four days it became progressively more sour and seemingly carbonated. Again, we had to toss most of the OJ. I had thought that our first experience was a one-off. But when it happened a second time, I thought you should know. We will not be purchasing this product again. I'm not asking for a refund. I'm just giving you feedback.",

Aside from the homemade one you make at home, this is the next best thing, it comes really close to homemade. It's just the right amount of avocados, creaminess, thickness and spices. Most other store - bought guacamole are either too acidic, too garlicky or too salty. But this one is just right. It's the closet thing next to homemade. I highly recommend it.

Presentation-wise = nice. Nothing to hate on. Comparable to fancy chocolate. Taste-wise = average. Sometimes chocolate just doesn't taste high-quality and plastic-y, which this one reminded me of. It wasn't horrible - just tasted like cheap grocery store chocolate. But as most chocolate eaters would probably agree in - chocolate is chocolate - can't really mess it up and even bad chocolate tastes like chocolate. These would be a good gift for kiddos on valentines. Or to go along with another gift. They all tasted very similar for the most part. Very sweet and sugary. Size for price could be a lot better.

The other thing i noticed is that the wire coming out does twist a hair when moving it but its not coming loose any time soon. I currently have mine set up flat with some velcro to keep it firmly in place. Overall, its a descent 4 port hub. i however may not use my ssd on it when i get said ssd. Charging my phone and maybe moving my logitech mouse dongle to it is probably how i will end up using this since i am currently using a laptop with limited usb ports available. It probably would be okay though for ssd too but i'm just not gonna. I feel its well worth the price listed though and because it works.",

A true USB 3.0 has the usual 4 of USB 2.0, but also has another 5 small ones tucked in between the larger 4 conductors. The plugs on this thing didn't have the addition 5 conductors and had transfer rates barely better than USB 2.0.",

Lots of cheap hubs give you just a few inches of cable to work with. 2. Having three ports on the top. A lot easier for plugging in jump drives and the like since you just push them down, other hubs you have to pick the hub up because the ports are all on the side. 3. The ports are arranged \"vertically\" rather than \"horizontally\". You'll know what I'm talking about if you've ever had a usb device that was really wide and you had to unplug the adjacent ports for it to fit in. Shouldn't have that problem here - awesome!",

First, they had a very strong chemical smell that didn't go away until they sat on my outside porch for nearly three weeks in the Florida heat and humidity. Second, one of the shoes is actually smaller than the other, so the first week I wore them, I had a nasty, raw blister on my Achilles tendon (ouch!!) that I had to cover up daily with gauze and tape until it healed. They are obviously not the same size! I attached a photo as evidence. The good news is that when the blister healed, that skin is thicker than it was and now it no longer hurts and I can wear the shoe without a band aid or gauze and tape LOL. If I wasn't part of the working class poor, I would have returned them and gotten a different shoe. But I got through the pain and smell of them and they're pretty comfortable! I did end up getting a thicker sole insert for them as I work in a kitchen and stand and walk all day.",

I ordered a track-suite with this in a 5X . I woke up to a email saying they cancelled part of my order- tracksuite because it was not in stock - even though it showed in stock. My refund took 10 days. WALMART PUT a 10 day hold on my refund %26 left the charge pending for 10 days even after I had to call customer service and ask where is my refund for un out of stock item. They said it can take up to 10 days and my bank even told me that Walmart put a 10 day hold on my redund.! Im sure this review will get taken down by them. Lol",

It was well incorporated, not watery or unusually messy, and seemed more chemically together than some past batches I've used.

Usually when I'm dealing with rashes it's because my 22 month old has tummy problems so there's diarrhea often. He has a milk allergy. And if he even gets some by accident it can affect him for quite a while after. So I usually just default to the powerful stuff or magic diaper cream I made myself. A pharmacy will tell you how to make this stuff! You can either use a fungal cream in it or not depending on the rash. Back again to the product though it does spread on nicely and I do enjoy that it doesn't smell like some type of petroleum product.",

We immediately noticed that the packaging and texture were different from when we used it for our first child just 3.5 years ago. For the past 2.5 months, we've been dealing with a mild diaper rash, visiting the doctor twice to have the rash cultured and giving extra air time to help with healing. Despite all this, we've only seen minimal improvement. Curious about the difference, I found an old tube of the Honest Diaper Rash Cream and compared the ingredients. After reading through older reviews, it became clear that the formula has changed. Sadly, the new formula hasn't been effective in protecting my baby's skin. We've decided to discontinue use, and after just two days, we've already seen noticeable improvement. If you're experiencing similar issues, I recommend trying other products first before sticking with this one.",

Honest was the first brand that did the job and did not burn. I have happily used it for several years. While away on vacation, I found myself in need of a cream.. I couldn't find Honest. I purchased something with similar ingredients. Brand new out of the box, the ingredients had separated into a gooey mess. I got my money back, but was miserable for the rest of the trip. . I returned home planning to purchase a spare tube of Honest Diaper Rash Cream to keep for travel only to find the ingredients had changed. Instead of a list of almost all natural ingredients, I found ingredients like Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacladipate-2 which is a synthetic emollient along with at least 8 or 9 other non-organic ingredients. It doesn't feel the same as my other tube of Honest Cream. It doesn't smell the same. I am very disappointed. I had been giving a tube of Honest Diaper Rash Cream to mothers at baby showers. I will be calling them to warn them about the changes. I do not know what I will do when my last tube of the original formula of Honest Diaper Rash Cream runs out.",

I am SO sad that they changed the formula. It is no longer effective. This is the only thing that healed my daughters skin and now I'm at a loss. I assume this change was done in an attempt to go vegan, but they truly missed the mark. Some things are better left alone and this is one of them. It's sad when a company sacrifices quality to fit into a \"box\". I'm all for using ethical products when it makes sense, but this product worked so well in its original formula.

I'm assuming this one is not? Anyway, I bought it twice trying to give it a shot, but I will no longer be purchasing this. I will have to find another brand.

We do not have much money extra these days laying around to waste, as I'm sure most others don't either; but would specifically make trips or spend the extra money to get this cream because it used to work that well, plus we liked the smell of the old one.

One of the first things that caught my attention about the Honest Diaper Rash Cream is its impressive list of ingredients. I love that it is made with natural and safe ingredients, giving me the peace of mind that I am using a product that is gentle on my daughter's delicate skin. It's a relief to know that I can apply this cream daily without any worry about harsh chemicals or irritants. The texture of this diaper rash cream is another standout feature for me. The thick consistency ensures that it stays in place and provides a protective barrier on my daughter's skin. Even when she wets her diaper, the cream doesn't easily rub off, offering long-lasting protection against irritation and redness. I appreciate how well it works to soothe and prevent diaper rash, making it a reliable solution for daily use.",
