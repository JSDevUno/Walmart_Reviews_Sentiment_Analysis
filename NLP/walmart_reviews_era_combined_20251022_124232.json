There was not, so I ordered based on the main photo and item specifications. If it doesn't include a container, change the description and exclude it from the photo. I checked the company's website after delivery and the same product with the same photos states it includes a container. Not sure if I will keep this since I'll need to buy a container of some sort.

The texture and matte white color give it a clean, elegant look that fits perfectly with my decor. It looks much more high-end than the price suggests! I especially love the subtle detailing and the handles — they give the vase a timeless, slightly rustic feel that works in both modern and traditional settings. My only wish is that it came in a larger size, especially for use as a centerpiece on bigger tables. Still, it's a lovely accent piece and a great value. I'd definitely buy it again or grab another if they release a taller version.",

He is 12yrs,, 5'11 185-190 pds,, Soo, I went up a size as said to 2xL(well ordered that, but received 3xL, eye roll) he normally wear about a XL or 1X in mens pants like that. But that wasn't just the issue. They were just terrible. They fit in the waist, but the crotch and back(as I said earlier) hung down to his knees,,,, and Not in anyone nice looking. The price was high as well. Now to try and figure out how to send them back, or refund. Will not buy another in this brand, ever. Very disappointed, because they look nice in the pictures. Hope this helps someone, somewhat :)))",

Bought these as an alternative to the really discount Walmart brand joggers of similar style, expecting these to be of superior fit and quality. Unfortunately seams were fraying from the get go and the construction was pretty poor after a few washes after some days of light use. Because this is a third party seller and the pants were already worn, there's nothing I can do about it as far as returning goes, so I'm just stuck with them. Don't waste your money here.",

Cargo pockets have pleats, so they will fit more than just something flat. 2 \"extra\" belt loops help quite a bit with extra equipment on the belt (pager, radio, keys, multi-tool, etc). Pants look best if taken out of the dryer warm and not too dry (use the energy efficiency setting) and then hung, or pressed; they are a bit prone to getting wrinkled if allowed to cool and dry in a pile.

A little warm for summer, but nice even then when the restaurant or bar you are in have their thermostat set on \"August\", or whatever it is that makes those places too cold to enjoy in the same clothes in which you came from the outdoors. Unlike other cargo pants I have, these have only the one slit pocket for a smart phone (it's on the left side), rather than one on each side, just in case that matters to you. A plus is that these pants come in odd-numbered waist sizes. I wanted a 31\"-inch waist (not a 30 or a 32), and that's what I got. And they fit perfectly.",

These Wrangler cargo pants (not jeans) are also supposedly 34's, but they are considerably smaller in the waist. They fit me very tight. It's difficult to tell much else about them, because I can't wear them. Since I'm in the process of losing weight, I'll hold onto them for a couple of weeks to see if I can get down to their size. They are also very stiff, at least they way they come from the factory. I suspect it's a lot of \"sizing\" that will wash out, but I can't be sure, because they fit so badly that I don't want to wash them and then not be able to return them.

Every year, I'd pick him up 3 pairs at tax time, and by the time it rolled around again, they were getting holes or losing buttons, and I'd replace them. In the last few years, things like losing buttons and ripping/unravelling seams have meant that instead of once a year, I'm buying them like three times a year. They're still the only pants my husband will wear, though, so I'm still buying them, and the price isn't bad, especially if you catch them on sale.

The tech pocket is way to small to fit a modern cell phone with a case. I saw one review where that was metioned and the response was basically they can't accommodate all tech which is very reasonable however I have a pair of wrangler pants with the tech pocket on the right at my fingertips and sized large enough to not cause an issue. I would have purchased that same style again but according to everything I have found wrangler doesn't make the pair I own already. With the wrangler tags. But these pants are pants and they meet their requirements.",

Instead of polyester, these pants have thicker threads of regular old cotton that give the pants the look of ripstop fabric without actually having the qualities I expect from ripstop clothing. I did try them on, and the pants do look good. So, if you like the ripstop look but don't care about durability, these might be for you.

The material is thin enough to be soft but thick enough to be durable. Very comparable with the Dickies cotton work pants but I think softer and more comfortable. These pants do fade some over time but not as bad as Dockers I have had. Back pockets are big enough for me to put my iPad mini in. Side cargo pockets are too but can't close the Velcro top. Careful if you get horizontal (lay down) with them as everything seems to empty out of the front pockets when you do. Transfer to the cargo pockets if your work gets you at that angle.

The only negative is that, for me at least, crotch area where my legs rub together always wears out eventually. It tears open. I'm overweight so that may be part of the reason. I haven't kept track of how long they last, a number of months possibly a year. I would recommend these to a friend because, considering the price, they last long enough and they do feel good.",

They run true to size and the rise is perfect. They are lightweight, cool and wear like iron. I've gotten them soaking wet a number of times and they've dried out completely within 15 to 20 minutes. I work in a rough environment and these pants have held up. Pockets are roomy and well placed for easy access but not bulky so they don't stick out and snag on rough edges. The cell phone pocket holds my iPhone 6 in LifeProof case securely but makes it easy to grab. That's about the max for the cell phone pocket but a larger size phone would easily fit in one of the cargo pockets.",

He really needs a 30x33 or 30x34, and they only make them up to a 30x32. After they are washed and dried, the leg length does shrink! I try to get them out of the dryer, before they are completely dried. Then I pull and stretch the legs out. This helps a little, but not much!

          "review_text": "Other Cargo Pants I have need to be ironed before wearing. The pocket flaps ball up, and they look wrinkled out of the dryer. The Wrangler Legacy Pants have been washed and dried 3 times some far and can be worn straight out of the dryer. The corners of the pocket covers are the only thing that would need to be ironed if you are going to get picky. I bought the black pants and they are suitable for casual dress. The fit on the pair I got is prefect at the waist and lenght. The pockets are deep and roomy, and that was important to me. The velcro flaps on the side pockets allow easy access, and keep important things like your wallet secure. They have a leg that is a bit wider than I like, however all things considered they are the best cargo pants I own. I plan to order them in the other color tonight. I hope that helps you decide.",

I have looked at similar pants that cost three times as much from the more liked brands but i have to say these seem to be the better pick for price and quality. The two cargo pockets allow great storage and convenience, i can put all kinds of stuff in them and they dont feel too odd when i have items in them. The device pocket combo stitched behind the cargo pocket on the left hand side in genius! It fits my Samsung Galaxy S7 in an Otterbox case great and it i have not had a problem with it. Really a great design, only cargo jeans i can find so far that does this. Quality is great, i used one pair rigorously the summer of 2016 and by the end of the year no tears but small, not even pea sized holes started to emerge. From what they've been through it was defiantly worth the $20 for a single pant. I bought 3 more pairs for my company uniform this year. Doesn't seem to stain bad with grass/dirt, etc. Very happy purchase and will continue to buy them. Thanks Wrangler!",

It stretches just enough to make sitting, bending, and walking incredibly comfortable. The quality feels durable, like they'll hold up for a long time.

The \"Flex\" fabric is a total game-changer, making them feel soft and comfortable from the moment you put them on. You can bend, sit, and move freely, which is perfect for an active day. I also really appreciate the timeless style and classic wash. They have a great look that's easy to pair with anything, whether I'm wearing a casual t-shirt or a nicer button-down. The blue wash is a versatile shade that works for almost any occasion. Overall, these jeans are a fantastic value.

          "review_text": "I ordered these and a regular size for my husband, who is a pretty big guy, mind you. There are two different versions of these pants. One isn't in-store where we live which fit perfectly. Then there's these monsters that somehow made it on the shelves. These pants are just goofy looking. The pant legs are so wide my husband could probably fit both legs in one pant leg alone. I couldn't remember which ones these were, we had bought a pair recently and my husband was swimming in them, they cause you to massively sweat in high temps and cause rashes, so I ordered an extra pair of regular fit just in case. Of course the random color I chose for regular fit was unavailable and now my husband is left with these monstrosities for his construction interview today (yes, jeans are appropriate). Super frustrating. Please take these off the local shelf or add the ones that don't have \"big men\" in the title because not everyone needs that much room and they can't fit skinny jeans, which seems to be the other options.",

The waist sizing of the non-flex versions are not even close to being correct. The 28 is a little bigger than the 29, but still a bit small. The waist of the flex version is bigger than the others and actually a bit too big, but multiple washings may take care of that. Also, the 30 length was at least 1 1/2 inches longer than specified on the non-flex version; the flex version looks pretty close to being correct. The flex fabric feels somewhat thinner than the non-flex jeans, but they are quite comfortable. We'll see how well they hold up over time. All in all, I recommend the flex relaxed fit Wrangler jeans. It's just too bad that Wrangler has such terrible quality control regarding sizing.",

There are two betwixt the sides and back loop (4 o'clock %26 8 o'clock). Perfect position for clipping on key ring.

Then if washed many times the elastic stop doing what it does and the \"denim fabric\" seems to get and keep the durability of wet paper. 4) Ordered what I thought was normal denim somehow got this flex fit trash but even though the tag says 44X32 (my waste is 43in) the so-called denim jeans have give of 7in in the waste?! Why?! 5) Just stop all jeans makers, stop putting this flex fit elastic trash in men's jeans! I want an actual denim pair of jeans with real denim that lasts more than 6 months.

However the dark denim (shown in my pic) and slate versions have significant polyester content (12 and 7 percent respectively) so they won't be as breathable on humid days. Same is true of at least one of the denim shorts (flex dark, not bought here). The cargo shorts I've tried are 98 percent cotton, 2 percent spandex, no polyester, which is fine. Be sure to inspect the labels sewn into the interiors of the jeans and shorts before you remove the tags and be prepared to return them if you want a true cotton/spandex blend. Five stars for the correctly labeled products, but overall rating has to be lower due to the mislabeling.",

I bought the shorts that I use for golf that have the 1% spandex and they are my favorite golf shorts. My older man belly could use some situps and normal pants are too tight for comfort. Larger size is too bulky. The 1% spandex allows the pants to stretch to button. The fit is snug, not pulling tight as would be with normal pants. The fit is comfortable. I am cleaning out my closet of older jeans, replacing with 1 % spandex as well as all golf shorts. Make polos with 1 % spandex and I will replace mine with those. Put the 1% spandex in cotton jackets, etc. It really, really works. Give a raise to the employee that came up with the 1 % spandex; genius!!!! Thanks for making clothes comfortable!

I have 3 other pairs of wrangler jeans all in size 40/30 and no problems in the waist and actually a little loose which is nice. One of those pairs is exactly this model jean. I don't want to upsize since then I am sure it will be too loose and unable to wear them. I have 60 days to return this item...maybe closer to 45 days, but its not worth paying to ship it back because I wouldn't break even on the return since i would be paying shipping twice.

The Indigo and Medium Stone fit perfectly as normal, and I'd give them 5 - Stars. The Coal Black on the other hand, are very tight. As all were ordered the same size and at the same time, I checked the sizing label to make sure all were as ordered. The Difference I found was the Indigo and Medium Stone called out 99% Cotton, 1% Spandex which is what the website description says whereas the Coal Black pair calls out 99% Cotton, 1% Elastane. Looking up \"Elastane\", it says it's another name for Spandex or Lycra. Something seems off as they don't fit. I really wanted a pair of Black Jeans comparable to fit of the blue ones but am now questioning if I was delivered the wrong pair of Coal Black Jeans or if I re-order, will they come as Cotton and Spandex or if I upsize, will I swim in them. Hate when I have to question my confidence in a product.",

Had it not been in the grouped with the type \"a\", I wouldn't have bought them. Unfortunately, you can't tell from Walmart's web site, because they all show 99% cotton. It isn't until you go to Wrangler's web site and you can see the material for each one. But because Wrangler groups them together, that's probably why Walmart groups them together. And Wrangler's naming and model convention is hard to decipher, so good luck. I found that the number starting with \"1097\" will work on a search if you drop the beginning \"10\".",

I don't know if it is the Wrangler companies fault or the fact that Walmart tells companies what they will be charging for the jeans and the companies have to skimp on materials to hit the price point. From everything I have read about how much control Walmart has with suppliers, I suspect it is the latter. First, the denim is extremely lightweight, not what you expect if you have ever purchased wranglers before. Second, they cut the denim too short on the back pane of the front pockets, so the stitching and white pocket fabric pucker out no matter what - even when you're standing straight up. This was the case on both pockets for all four pair that I bought. I probably should have learned from the last time I bought Rustler jeans from Walmart. They, too, were very lightweight, they didn't have the tiny front pocket, and the insufficient number of belt loops tore out very easy as did the back pockets.",

I would recommend sizing up though, the pant has a very small/short rise, and it could feel tight I. The groin if you are bigger or heavier. If very slim or skinny, you're good with regular size. I'm heavy, so I ordered a 36, instead of my usual 34, and they fit just right. Awesome pants. I do wish and hope that Dickies could add more colors to the 873 Slim line.",

Shorter rise than 874's should work better for me since I wear pants on the hip (there's nothing else for them to hang onto). Had to alter the pants by taking up about 1.5\" at the back of the waistband (after washing and drying with high heat), feathering the take-out half-way down the seat. So tailored, they now fit well. The \"size up\" guidance for 874's does not apply to this pair of pants.",

They are very comfortable and fit well, except that they are low rise so tucking a shirt in the pants makes you think they should be higher making them tight in the crotch. This is only noticable putting them on in the beginning of the day and disappears once you start moving. Also after the first wash the dye on the edge of the pleat faded a lot making the pleat stand out more than usual. Bought the first pair in navy and am waiting on the second pair in chocolate brown. Works for everything I want it for just wish it was a mid rise pant to give more room.",

There's some light pilling (a surface defect of textiles caused by wear) on the thigh / crouch area already after wearing them consistently for a week (I also noted some stretching of the seems, showing the thread, but it's nothing I am worried about currently). While this may not be a sign of poor craftmanship, or materials used: I am aware of it. The front waist of the pants sits higher than I personally expected. It does ride up over my belt, which causes odd bunching, and correcting every so often. It's not terrible by any means. It may seem like I do not like these pants, but I really do love them, and the company Dickies overall. I may try a different cut next time, but these may become my \"go-to\" pair for a long while. Very recommended, but please keep note of my light concerns after three-ish weeks of wearing these.",

I am a bboy so it makes it look more professional as opposed to wearing sweat pants. It's easy to move around in when I dance (such as sliding or spinning on the floor). They are also are great to wear for work during my normal day job. The side pockets can fit a smartphone when I sit in a chair.

They are very durable and kinda stiff when you first try them on. I would recommend washing them first before wearing them and also, I would recommend buying a size up ie. if you wear a 34/30 get a 36/30 instead. They shrink over a period of time and they will eventually become a size 34 by the time it's worn and wash enough. It would be nice to have a shorter seam length like down to a 26 or 28 for the shorter leg folks. Otherwise, good pants for automotive attire.",

Without thinking much of it I bought these pants in my normal size. The crotch fit very shallow relative to where the waste is, so my plums were getting some serious interference from the pants, as was my bum. They also seemed a little short. I made a hassle-free exchange for a pair that was one waste size and one leg length larger and that seemed to take care of the problem.

When I got them I realized I should have ordered TWO SIZES smaller than all of my other pants. I still can't believe how big the waist was considering the website mentioned nothing about this fit running large. They were ridiculously large. No where in the description does it say these pants run large so I ordered the same size of the dickies I buy at the store. I would have returned them but I needed my work pants right away and did not have time to go through the return and exchange process. Dealing with other companies before and understanding that not much can be done for compensation I just left it alone and lived with wearing these pants way too big. I don't have much free time and I work hard for my money. I don't make much money so when I spend my hard-earned money and invest it and something that I need I would assume that I would get what I thought I was ordering. I am only writing this review right now because I just received an email requesting my review on the specific item months later after my initial purchase. Other then being disappointed in the sizing these pants are great but I will not be ordering from the website anymore I probably won't buy any more dickies at all",

The thick material though didn't let the leg opening settle/soften down but it measures 8\" as it stated. The only thing I didn't like is the rise it's extremely low and believe me it's not new to me. But for the cut and what they are trying to market I don't think that low of a rise made any sense. I have fairly slim legs usually wear 6-7\" hem openings. So I ended up donating the pants to church. I'll guess I'll try the slim taper they have and pray it isn't too tight because of the thicker material",

Have to wear these very low on the hips and almost sag. It's so bad that it feels like walking around with a permanent wedgie and a visible crease in the crack. I'm struggling to understand what kind of person would fit well in these, as someone with a slim build and almost no behind I don't see how anyone with a thicker build could comfortably wear these without these pants completely riding up their rear. Going to keep these in hopes that they loosen up a bit over time and because they're cheap with a nice fit around the legs.",

I def recommend using a primer because it does tend to crease. My gripe with this product which is also the reason why I even pulled up to this page to see if other people had the same problem is that it isn't a twist up! And you can't sharpen it because it comes in a plastic casing so once I used up the tip I didn't know what to do. And I was very frustrated because I was guessing there is product all the way down the inside of the tube I just didn't know how to get to it. So I deadass just cut through the plastic to get to the rest of the color which is ridiculous but it worked.",

          "review_text": "I wish they made it more clear on here, or on packaging. It is not a “twist” even though the bottom is plastic, there's a ton of more makeup - INSIDE. I got a really cheap jumbo makeup pencil sharpener online that came in 2 days for it. It does have a tiny cap on the sharpener you'll need to take off to fit (I know sounds like a butt, but SO easy) I was confused for a bit, I was like surely it has more in it than this until I saw a review saying what to do lol on the actual makeup part though- this is my favorite. I've probably tried I dunno 100? Maybe highlights from doing cosmetology, and loving makeup for forever. This one works for me personally (different for everyone obviously) I have oily skin, but can get a dry nose in winter/ if I do a peel mask. This is the only one that doesn't look like my makeup is separating or coming off. I put some on the tops of checks, under my eyebrow, and nose. Usually where I can see light is hitting naturally. It is very moveable. If you are planning on putting it on your eyelids too- I would steer clear of that idea, for this product if your eyelids are oily like mine. It will crease. Also I put a little in my lower inner eye to make me look more awake lol. ANYWAY highly recommend, just takes a sec to sharpen it once in awhile. BTW it will sound like plastic%26 you might be confused when you sharpen it, but it is pushing up product! :) good luck with your makeup :) Also last thought- I don't put much product out in case it does break off somehow so I don't lose any of the product.",

However, it won't ever \"settle down\" so it will smudge no matter how long you let it sit and it'll transfer if you have oily lids. I have slightly oily lids, so the creasing doesn't bother me. I actually think the mild creasing is great for a wearable editorial look. SHARPENING TIP I followed a youtube video where the girl put the pencil in the freezer for 15 minutes before sharpening. It makes sharpening a creamy pencil much easier. The \"plastic\" bit is actually more of a shiny/waxy coating to make it look more appealing. The pencil itself is made of paper.",

          "review_text": "I had never tried shadow sticks before and felt it was time to step it up. Since NYX manufactures a good quality product at a great price, I felt this was a good place to start. Of the 5 colors I purchased my favorites are Slate which I have used as a liner and in the outer corner of my eyelid for a smoky eye, and Strawberry Milk which is my absolute favorite. It is the perfect highlighter for my skin tone. My only complaint is that when I went to retrieve it from my Muji, the shadow portion had somehow separated from the stick. I don't know why or how since I immediately put it in the Muji after using it. I took a tissue and gently pressed it back where it was supposed to be and after a couple of tries it finally seemed to work. Sparkle Nude is lovely as a shadow or highlighter. The color I looked forward to trying the most was Milk. I'm still playing with this one because I haven't gotten the result I was expecting when using it to make my shadows pop. I think I may be using too much or may need to forgo the shadow base I use before Milk to get the result I'm looking for. Milk is a pretty creamy white and I can see multiple uses for it. I also got Bronze which is okay; I actually prefer the Glam Shadow Stick I got in Fard Glamour because the color seems much richer and it really glides over my eyelid. Overall I'm very happy with NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils, and would have rated it excellent had that little problem not happened.",

The brown and the blue are genius to use under brown or blue powder eyeshadows, as they really help the color come through (even in a smoky look) and they don't interfere too madly with blending. They also both work AMAZINGLY under duo-chrome brown and blue powder shadows -- they really help the two-tone effect pop. Seriously, try the brown under Mac Club. Just do it. As for the Milk, I love this pencil for priming under my eyes when I want to smoke out a look (but not look like a raccoon by 5 pm), and its also a brilliant primer for those days when I'm in a rush and I don't have time to fiddle around with brushes and eyeshadow base drying times and such like that. And if I'm in an even bigger rush, I've also just swiped the brown on my lid and spread it a bit with a concealer brush (and/ or finger) and it passes well as a one-and-done shadow/ liner, too. You can't miss with these (just be sure to use a primer underneath for richest color payoff).",

Sometimes, I build the color intensely by the lash line and then blend it out with bronze shadow for a pretty effect. The name \"gold\" is misleading...I would consider it a warm, metallic bronze or more of an antique gold. You can wear it without a primer for 10 hours without it creasing, which is great if you have only a short time to do your makeup in the morning. I would repurchase this color, and I would be interested in buying more colors in the future!",

It is super soft, glides on beautifully, i have the dark blue and it's a beautiful color of blue that accentuates my skin tone and eyes, but I don't see how you can sharpen it. I have a variety of sharpeners and it doesn't fit in any, and it's in a plastic casing. It would have to be really unique sharpener to work. Is it going to shave off part of the plastic? Or is it just sharpening the tip? Because there's really not much colored pencil underneath there. If you have used it quite a few times and you just want to sharpen the tip, you can't push it up far enough to get it high enough to sharpen the tip. Love the product, but cannot recommend due to the sharpening issue. Maybe you should post a video how to sharpen!?",

It just amused me that every review that mentions this fact is responded to by telling them that they can sharpen it. \"Sure, it's wasteful and deceptive but did you know that you can sharpen it? because you can totally sharpen it!\" Oh well.

Unfortunately, I assumed- because the pencil is clearly plastic, and the packaging is not clear at all that to GET AT the whole thing you HAVE TO SHARPEN OFF THE >PLASTIC< (whose not brilliant idea was that?)- that it would twist up. Like every other reviewer who mentions this feature, I find this design to be absolutely trash. Firstly because no one would expect this and the packaging does not clarify it, and secondly because even if you DO already own a sharpener that can manage it, you can never get the last bit out. While another reviewer gave a solution for extracting and potting the color, which is super resourceful, I actually wanted a soft-color pencil. With all the negative feedback and poor communication in the packaging, I really feel NYX should be sending people a refund or coupon for purchase price toward another product until they redesign this clear dud. On the upside, the product consistency is very versatile and the colors are great. Would welcome a \"We want to make this right\" action from the company! In the meantime will likely keep looking for this perfect color in another brand of twist-up pencil.",

Now the WORST thing: the packaging. I hate that there's plastic just under the actual product so that you can't sharpen the pencil!

          "review_text": "I'll admit. I love the product inside the pencil. It works well as an eyeshadow base. However, I've had this for a pretty decent amount of time but nearly never use it. Why? Because I don't have the grip strength of a Burmese python holding onto a particularly delicious rat. I don't have the power of a fully grown silverback gorilla. I cannot twist with the force and fury of a thousand supernovae. Which seems to be a requirement to use more than just the little nubbin atop the pencil itself. I know there's more product in there. I have been scouring the internet for two hours trying to find an easier way to get at the sweet goodness of Jumbo Eye Pencil. But try as I might, it eludes me. Sharpening this thing is like trying to extract Excalibur from the stone. One must have the royal lineage of Camelot to experience the privilege of applying this. Even with the advice to freeze it, to use the NYX brand dual sided sharpener, to turn it just so, and to sell my soul to the Devil himself... I can't sharpen this. The callouses I have on my hands from years of opening up soda bottles have been shredded by this seemingly innocuous eye pencil. I am sitting in tears, one eye half finished, as my mangled pencil sits in the freezer yet again in the hopes of making it accessible to me. No one else in my house has conquered the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil, either. I know it is not just a moral failing on my part. In all seriousness, the design choice of using a smooth, semi-hard plastic instead of something like wood is, in my opinion, abysmal. I wasn't kidding about the callouses, or the fact that I am literally crying in frustration. Does anyone have any advice besides \"You can use a sharpener!\" because at this point I'm ready to painstakingly scrape it out and put it in a pot so I can apply it with a brush. I've learned that you can pry off the non-functional end of the pencil with pliers and push it out, so if the new sharpener I ordered doesn't work I'm gonna try that and give an update. As nice as this product is, really not worth the trouble of actually using it.",

My only qualm is that I want to try the other shades but for some reason, Milk is the only shade that comes in plastic safety wrapping at the store.

The Jumbo pencil is just what I wanted. The creamy texture does not “settle” and feels nice on the lid, not heavy. Great for older crepe-y eyes. Super blendable while staying put on the eye. Many great colors to choose. I don't understand so many negative reviews about having to sharpen the product. It says right there, jumbo PENCIL.",

I can't get over how gorgeous the color is, and though I thought it would be far too warm for me, I'm so glad I gave it a try. The formula feels light and moisturizing, not heavy and waxy at all, but there is good color payoff. That lightness of feeling comes at the cost of having to apply a little more frequently, but that's no big deal because it only goes where you put it so this isn't a messy, slippery, bleeding-outside-the-lines stick that requires a mirror and complicated reapplication of liner and the whole nine. Breeze resembles a $20 Origins shade I used to love, and the just-right level of sheen and feeling of moisture mean I don't have to apply a gloss topcoat. It's just plain pretty. Can't believe this kind of classy shade is such a bargain buy. It's a perfect purse lippie that will go with almost everything.",

No clue how long it lasts since I had to wipe it off pretty quickly. Turns out the smell also means it leaves a terrible taste on my lips that I just couldn't stand. It might have only been $1, but that was a completely wasted $1. It really sucks since I've used plently of other wet n wild makeup products and haven't had such a terrible experience.",

Though they did feel quite nice while on my lips, but they did fade a bit on their own, and tend end up almost done after a meal. But then again, it's almost impossible to find a silk finish lip product immune to transferring, so I'll let that one slide. Overall, as a backup, I think this lipstick is okay, but as an everyday lipstick you'd reach for, I don't know.. The quality for the price was impressive, like I said, but not too great.

The name does not lie, this lipstick does apply and feel just like silk. I found it to be very hydrating and I did not see the product bleed like most drugstore lipsticks do. That being said, I wasn't impressed with the coverage. I found the pigment to be quite rich, which I loved. Yet, after a few applications the color did fade and it faded fast over time. I found that one or two applications did the job just right. I would use this product again, but for more of a natural barely-there look.",

I ALWAYS like my lips (the outer part of them)and blot with paper towel, that's how I get them to stay for HOURS or until I eat something. This also dramatically reduces transfer. These are all my favorite lipsticks; however, I do find they change color and get waxy-smelling within less than a month, sometimes less than 2 weeks, regardless of storing method and use (I've tried various ways). They also have too little variety. I wish there were at least more purple tones or a black or blue one.",

Probably not, i dont know if anyone else had the problem that i had but i did end up trowing it out because the shade i knew i was never going to use.",
