      "review_text": "This took my husband and me about 3 hours to assemble. The locking nuts were quite challenging, as some were defective. We didn't realize at first that they include extra screws and partsâ€”thankfully, because we had about five locking screws that didn't lock properly. You'll definitely need patience! However, once assembled, the final product is sturdy, beautiful, and the fireplace works great. A heads-up: if you only have one electrical outlet for both the fireplace and TV, this setup won't work. The fireplace requires its own dedicated outlet, so you'll need to find another outlet for the TV or other devices.",
